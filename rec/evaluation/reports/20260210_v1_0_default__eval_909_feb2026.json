            "[openai] Strong alignment. The top-10 is heavily focused on AI/tech infrastructure and strategic VC analysis (Nvidia, AI infrastructure, OpenAI, investment thesis), matching the 85% specialization and the preference for strategic over pure research. Cross-disciplinary curiosity is present but limited (space, American dynamism, generalist VC themes), roughly in the expected ~15\u201320% range. Minor deviations: recommendations lean toward high-profile opinion/podcast formats (a16z, Andreessen, Horowitz) rather than deeper, targeted coverage of defense-tech or enterprise-software infrastructure and supply-chain deep dives. Also, several items risk mirroring cold-start popular content (same marquee voices), so model-selection sensitivity could be stronger by injecting more niche infrastructure/adjacent-sector bridge pieces. Overall: solid fit with room to diversify toward defense-tech, enterprise infra, and supply-chain/regulatory deep dives.",

All recommendations are heavily focused on AI/Tech infrastructure, strategic analysis, and feature prominent VCs/thought leaders, fulfilling the 85% specialization and preference for strategic analysis. Several recommendations subtly integrate cross-disciplinary curiosity by linking AI to macro trends, economic impact, and national strategy (e.g., American Dynamism, AI sovereignty, space-based AI), providing the requested 'bridge' content and satisfying the 15% curiosity. The strong presence of a16z content also matches the user profile.",
            "[anthropic] The recommendations show strong specialization in AI/Tech (100% of top 10), which overshoots the 85% target and completely misses the 15% cross-disciplinary component. While the AI infrastructure focus aligns well with the hypothesis (covering AI capex, chips via Nvidia mentions, VC strategy), there's zero representation of the stated adjacent interests (defense-tech, enterprise software) or 'bridge content' linking AI to other investment themes. The preference for 'strategic analysis over pure research papers' is well-met through a16z podcasts and VC-focused discussions. However, the lack of any macro content connecting to chip supply chains or tech regulation, and absence of defense-tech despite the user profile's explicit interest, indicates the algorithm is over-indexing on demonstrated AI engagement without honoring the stated cross-disciplinary curiosity. This represents partial alignment\u2014strong on core specialization, weak on the exploration component."

                "Excellent diversity match for an 85% specialization profile. All 10 recommendations are firmly within AI/tech infrastructure (Marc Andreessen on AI, Martin Casado on AI infrastructure, Elon Musk on AI in space, multiple a16z AI episodes), providing deep vertical variety within the core domain. The profile shows appropriate specialization with slight variation through different lenses: VC strategy (#1, #4, #7, #9), infrastructure economics (#6, #8), and future predictions (#2, #3, #10). The Ben Horowitz episode (#5) on 'Backing America's Future' provides the prescribed 15% cross-disciplinary bridge content connecting to defense-tech and national competitiveness\u2014exactly as hypothesized. No scattered recommendations outside the core focus area. Minor deduction only because a second bridge piece (e.g., chip supply chains, tech regulation) could strengthen the 15% cross-disciplinary element.",

All 10 recommendations are firmly within AI/tech infrastructure (Andreessen on AI, Musk on AI in space, Casado on AI infrastructure, Horowitz on AI investing), providing deep specialization as expected. The variety WITHIN the AI domain is excellent - covering investment strategy, infrastructure economics, hardware/chips, enterprise adoption, and AI sovereignty. The 15% cross-disciplinary element appears in #5 (Horowitz on 'Backing America's Future' touching defense-tech/American Dynamism) and #9 (Benchmark partnership discussion with broader VC themes). This is appropriate 'bridge content' connecting AI to adjacent investment themes. The only minor gap preventing a perfect 10 is that defense-tech and enterprise software adjacencies could be slightly more pronounced, but the current mix is very well-calibrated for this specialist profile."

            "[openai] Strong match to the profile: recommendations are predominantly VC/strategy-focused AI content (a16z, Marc Andreessen, Ben Horowitz, Martin Casado) and include cross-disciplinary bridge pieces (Elon/space, AI sovereignty) that align with the user\u2019s interest in AI infra, capex, and policy. Minor gaps: a slight tilt toward high-level VC commentary rather than deeper technical/operational infra (chips, datacenter ops, deployment economics) and some repetition of similar macro voices \u2014 so not a perfect 85/15 specialist split but very close to the user\u2019s stated preferences.",
            "[gemini] The recommendations align exceptionally well with the user's AI/Tech focus (85% specialization), strategic analysis preference, and heavy consumption of a16z content. Multiple recommendations feature Marc Andreessen, Martin Casado, and Ben Horowitz, directly reflecting recent engagements and preferred sources. The 'Key insight' for each recommendation consistently highlights AI investment, infrastructure, or strategic implications. The cross-disciplinary curiosity (15%) is addressed by recommendations connecting AI to space infrastructure (Elon Musk) and American Dynamism/defense-tech (Ben Horowitz), providing relevant 'bridge' content without straying too far from the core interest. No pure research papers are included, matching the preference for strategic analysis. The only minor gap is that while defense-tech and enterprise software were mentioned for cross-disciplinary curiosity, only defense-tech (via American Dynamism) is clearly touched upon, with enterprise software being less explicit.",
            "[anthropic] Strong alignment with the user's AI/tech infrastructure focus. 9 of 10 recommendations are directly about AI investment strategy, infrastructure, and tech trends from credible VC sources (a16z heavily featured, matching user's consumption pattern). The content appropriately emphasizes strategic analysis over pure research (Andreessen on AI investment, Casado on demand forces, Horowitz on VC strategy). However, there's limited representation of the 15% cross-disciplinary curiosity mentioned in the hypothesis - only one recommendation touches defense-tech (Ben Horowitz's 'Backing America's Future'), and there's minimal content bridging AI to adjacent sectors like chip supply chains or enterprise software infrastructure that the user has engaged with (Snowflake/Databricks). The 85/15 specialization ratio skews closer to 90/10 in practice. One recommendation (#4) is a duplicate of a recent bookmark, which is redundant. Overall, excellent core relevance but could better satisfy the stated cross-disciplinary interests."

The remaining recommendations are within the broader venture capital/tech domain, which is a reasonable adjacent exploration given the user's specific engagements.",

However, the relevance diminishes in the lower rankings with recommendations about AI, gaming, and general VC topics (items 5, 7, 8, 10) that don't connect to the crypto focus. The single click on AI content suggests some tech breadth, but the bookmark behavior clearly emphasizes crypto as the primary interest. A stronger set would frontload more crypto-specific content and reserve broader tech topics for exploration rather than mixing them throughout the top 10."
