            "[openai] Strong match: most picks are a16z/VC-level strategic conversations (Marc Andreessen, Martin Casado, Horowitz) and cover AI infrastructure, hardware (Nvidia) and market strategy \u2014 directly aligned with an AI/tech\u2011infra focused VC. Also includes relevant cross-disciplinary items (space-based AI). Minor gaps: the list is podcast/interview heavy and a bit repetitive; it lacks deeper technical/engineering or chip\u2011supply\u2011chain deep dives the user sometimes prefers.",
            "[gemini] The recommendations perfectly align with the user's content hypothesis and interests. They are heavily concentrated on AI/Tech infrastructure and strategic analysis from a VC perspective, often featuring key figures like Marc Andreessen, Ben Horowitz, and Martin Casado, and a strong presence of a16z content, mirroring recent engagements. The cross-disciplinary curiosity is subtly addressed through content connecting AI to space infrastructure, national tech strategy (American Dynamism), and broader economic comparisons relevant to AI capex and market dynamics.",
            "[anthropic] Strong alignment with the user's AI/tech infrastructure focus. 9 of 10 recommendations directly address AI investment strategy, infrastructure, and tech leadership\u2014matching the 85% specialization target. The content sources (a16z heavy presence, Dwarkesh, Lenny's) align with demonstrated preferences. However, there's a gap in the 15% cross-disciplinary curiosity: missing defense-tech, chip supply chains, or AI regulation content that the hypothesis explicitly calls for. The Ben Horowitz 'American Dynamism' episode (#10) touches on this briefly, but the list could benefit from 1-2 more 'bridge' pieces connecting AI to adjacent sectors like semiconductors or tech policy. Quality is high with appropriate strategic analysis over pure research, but the specialization ratio appears closer to 95/5 than the hypothesized 85/15."

All 10 recommendations are deeply focused on AI/tech infrastructure and VC strategy (perfect for the specialist core), with subtle variety within the domain: AI infrastructure economics (Casado), space-based AI (Musk), American Dynamism/defense-tech bridge (Horowitz #5, #10), and VC firm strategy (Benchmark). The recommendations successfully provide depth in AI while touching adjacent themes like defense-tech and macro AI investment trends. The only minor gap: could use one more explicit 'bridge' piece on chip supply chains or tech regulation to fully satisfy the 15% cross-disciplinary curiosity for macro/adjacent sectors. Overall, excellent specialization with appropriate intra-domain variety.",
                "The recommendations strongly align with the 85/15 specialization prescription. All 10 episodes center on AI/tech infrastructure (Andreessen on AI boom, Casado on AI demand, Musk on AI in space, etc.), providing deep variety WITHIN the AI/tech domain as appropriate for a specialist. The 15% cross-disciplinary element is satisfied through 'bridge content' - Horowitz's American Dynamism discussion (#5, #10) connects AI to defense-tech/national security, and the Benchmark episode (#9) touches on broader VC strategy. The content avoids pure research papers in favor of strategic analysis from practitioners (a16z partners, top VCs). Minor deduction only because the cross-disciplinary bridges could be slightly more prominent to hit the exact 15% mark, but overall this is excellent domain-focused diversity for a specialist with targeted curiosity.",
                "The diversity level is well-calibrated for this specialist profile. 9/10 recommendations are squarely in AI/tech infrastructure (Marc Andreessen on AI, Elon Musk on AI infrastructure, Martin Casado on AI demand, AI opportunity beyond models, etc.), matching the 85% specialization requirement. The Ben Horowitz 'American Dynamism' episode (#5) provides the prescribed 15% cross-disciplinary element, connecting AI to defense-tech and national competitiveness\u2014exactly the 'bridge content' the hypothesis calls for. All content stays within the strategic/investment lens rather than pure research. Minor deduction: could benefit from one more piece on adjacent sectors like chip supply chains or enterprise software to fully realize the cross-disciplinary curiosity, but overall the specialization-to-exploration ratio is appropriate."

            "[openai] Strong alignment: the top recommendations are explicitly crypto-focused (top 3 are crypto/stablecoin/chain discussions) and several others reference crypto or crypto-adjacent topics (stablecoins, Bitcoin, web3). This indicates bookmark-weighting is dominating the user vector. Minor deviation: the list still includes multiple non-crypto tech/VC/AI items (gaming, AI, general VC), so the set is somewhat exploratory rather than narrowly specialized. Format preferences and finer interest boundaries aren\u2019t addressed. Overall, recommendations reflect the bookmark-heavy crypto signal well but could be tighter on crypto-only content.",
            "[gemini] The user exclusively bookmarked crypto content, and the inferred hypothesis is that this topic should dominate the recommendations. The recommendations show strong alignment, with 5-6 out of 10 items directly focused on crypto (including the top 3 recommendations). The remaining recommendations are related to venture capital, AI, or gaming, which are adjacent to the broader tech/innovation space. While crypto is clearly a primary focus, the presence of these other topics prevents it from an absolute 'domination' of the list, indicating strong alignment with minor, relevant deviations.",
            "[anthropic] With no explicit Content Hypothesis, evaluation is based on engagement patterns. The user has 3 engagements with bookmarked crypto content. The recommendations show strong alignment: 6 of the top 10 episodes (including top 3) directly focus on crypto/blockchain (Balaji on crypto, Coinbase CEO on crypto trends, Jeremy Allaire on digital finance, Palmer Luckey on Bitcoin, Circle CEO on stablecoins, and a16z crypto podcast). All recommendations are high-quality (C=4, I=3, Quality=0.80-0.90), demonstrating the system correctly weighted bookmarks over clicks to identify crypto as the dominant interest. The remaining 4 episodes cover adjacent tech/VC topics that provide reasonable diversification without abandoning the core pattern. The test context confirms this is intentional - bookmarks should outweigh clicks - and the results deliver crypto-heavy recommendations as expected. Minor deduction for lack of explicit exploration strategy, but given the constraint of working from engagement patterns alone, the alignment is strong."
