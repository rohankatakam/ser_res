            "[openai] Partial alignment. The user\u2019s bookmarks show a clear crypto/NFT/DAO focus, but only ~2\u20133 of the 10 recommendations explicitly target crypto (Coinbase CEO, Jeremy Allaire, possibly Ben Horowitz/Balaji), while the majority skew toward VC/AI/tech. That indicates a higher exploration ratio than the user\u2019s demonstrated specialization. Cross-disciplinary suggestions (VC, AI) could be relevant if the user has broader tech/entrepreneurial curiosity, but given the strong crypto signals, the set should include more NFT/DAO/Ethereum-focused pieces to better match interests.",
            "[gemini] The recommendations effectively identify the user's primary interest in crypto (based on two bookmarks) with the top three recommendations being highly relevant. They also incorporate the user's secondary interest in AI/Venture Capital (based on a recent click) in the subsequent recommendations. This demonstrates a strong initial alignment with the primary interest and a reasonable exploration into a related secondary interest, showing strong alignment with minor gaps rather than partial alignment."
