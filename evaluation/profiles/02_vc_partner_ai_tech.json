  "name": "VC Partner — AI/Tech Focus",
  "description": "Active VC partner tracking AI developments, infrastructure investments, and tech strategy. Heavy consumer of a16z content and technical deep-dives. Content Hypothesis: 85% Specialization in AI/Tech infrastructure with 15% cross-disciplinary curiosity in adjacent sectors (defense-tech, enterprise software). Prefers strategic analysis over pure research papers. Cross-Disciplinary Curiosity: Open to macro content if it connects to AI capex, chip supply chains, or tech regulation. Should see occasional 'bridge' content linking AI to other investment themes.",

    "High similarity scores for AI/tech infrastructure episodes",
