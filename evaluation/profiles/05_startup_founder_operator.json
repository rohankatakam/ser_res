  "description": "New user (1 day) who is a startup founder looking for tactical advice on product, growth, and scaling. Tests warm start behavior with minimal engagement data. Content Hypothesis: 80% Specialization in founder/operator content (product, growth, team building, fundraising). Cross-Disciplinary Curiosity: Moderate—open to AI content if it's about applying AI in products, not AI research. Prefers tactical how-to content and founder journey stories over macro analysis or pure investment commentary.",
