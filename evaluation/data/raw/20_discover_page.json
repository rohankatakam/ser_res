                    "description": "<p>Before NFTs were a category and crypto was an industry, two artists released 10,000 characters into the world with no roadmap, no pitch, and no expectations. What started as an art experiment in code ended up flourishing into a movement about ownership and identity. In this episode of <em>Possible</em>, Reid sits down with Matt Hall and John Watkinson, co-founders of Larva Labs and creators of CryptoPunks, to trace how a small creative experiment became one of the most influential cultural phenomenons of the internet era. They reflect on what it means for art to live on-chain, why decentralization was a design choice rather than a slogan, and how digital identity became one of the most valuable real estates online. From museums and blockchains to profile pictures, permanence, the conversation explores how letting go of narrative control can allow culture and community to write the story themselves.</p>\n<p><br></p>",

Not as a metaphor or an online community, but as a system that replaces institutions we usually think of as fixed, money, law, and governance.</p><p>In this conversation taken from The Network State Podcast, a16z cofounder Ben Horowitz joins Balaji Srinivasan to explore how internet native institutions are beginning to mirror and challenge traditional state structures. Drawing parallels to China’s early special economic zones, they discuss how constrained experiments like Shenzhen tested new rules without rewriting the entire system, and why similar experimentation is now happening online.</p><p>The discussion examines crypto, digital identity, and network states as attempts to turn code into coordination and coordination into legitimacy, while grappling with a core tension. Code is deterministic, but societies are not. Ben and Balaji explore where these systems work, where they break, and whether network states are a curiosity or the next phase of governance.</p><p> </p><p>Resources:</p><p>Follow Ben on X: https://x.com/bhorowitz</p><p>Follow Balaji on X: https://x.com/balajis</p><p>Listen to more from The Network State: <a href=\"https://ns.com/podcast\">https://ns.com/podcast</a></p><p> </p><p>Stay Updated:</p><p>If you enjoyed this episode, be sure to like, subscribe, and share with your friends!</p><p>Find a16z on X: <a href=\"https://x.com/a16z\">https://x.com/a16z</a></p><p>Find a16z on LinkedIn: </p><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z</a></p><p>Listen to the a16z Podcast on Spotify: <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/5bC65RDvs3oxnLyqqvkUYX\">https://open.spotify.com/show/5bC65RDvs3oxnLyqqvkUYX</a></p><p>Listen to the a16z Podcast on Apple Podcasts: <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a16z-podcast/id842818711\">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a16z-podcast/id842818711</a></p><p>Follow our host: <a href=\"https://x.com/eriktorenberg](https://x.com/eriktorenberg\">https://x.com/eriktorenberg](https://x.com/eriktorenberg</a></p><p>Please note that the content here is for informational purposes only; should NOT be taken as legal, business, tax, or investment advice or be used to evaluate any investment or security; and is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any a16z fund. a16z and its affiliates may maintain investments in the companies discussed.

This episode starts with Farcaster’s pivot and Tarun’s claim that “Web3 is dead,” at least the A16z-style ownership economy. With Web3 social struggling, the crew digs into why spam, airdrops, and weak network effects keep sinking these apps — and why prediction markets may be crypto’s accidental social network.</p>\n<p>We then jump to the L1 valuation fight. Haseeb recaps his debate with Santiago over whether chains are wildly overpriced or simply early, sparking a broader discussion on PE ratios, L1 “premiums,” and how many chains the world can realistically sustain.</p>\n<p>Next up: Ken Chan’s viral “I wasted 8 years in crypto.” The team unpacks burnout, sugar-water loops, and why nihilism tends to hit founders right as the market turns. And finally, Tarun walks through his ADL research and how October 10’s cascading liquidations exposed major flaws in current systems.</p>\n<p>Markets evolving, narratives collapsing — let’s get into it.</p>\n<p>Show highlights</p>\n<p>🔹 Farcaster pivots; Tarun calls A16z-style “ownership economy” Web3 (NFTs, own-your-posts) officially dead.</p>\n<p>🔹 Web3 social stalls — Twitter clones drowned in spam, airdrop farming, and weak network effects; prediction markets emerge as the <em>real</em> crypto social layer.</p>\n<p>🔹 Users’ revealed prefs — People claim to want decentralization/privacy but consistently choose convenience and incumbents.</p>\n<p>🔹 RIP “Web3” — Term traced from Gavin Wood to A16z marketing; panel agrees it no longer reflects where crypto is actually succeeding.</p>\n<p>🔹 L1 valuation battle — Santi’s PE-ratio critique vs Haseeb’s long-horizon “onchain finance will be huge” thesis; debate centers on how to value chains post-ICO/NFT era.</p>\n<p>🔹 How many L1s survive? — Tarun expects activity to concentrate in a small set due to issuance, liquidity, and coordination costs; L1 “premium” still props up dino chains.</p>\n<p>🔹 Burnout + disillusionment — Ken Chan’s “I wasted 8 years” resonates but feels mistimed amid strong fundamentals; panel contrasts sugar-water casino loops with real infra building.</p>\n<p>🔹 ADL failures exposed — Tarun’s research shows October 10’s cascading liquidations revealed outdated ADL assumptions; better algorithms could’ve saved hundreds of millions.</p>\nHosts⁠\n<p>⭐️<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hosseeb\"><u>Haseeb Qureshi</u></a>, Managing Partner at Dragonfly </p>\n<p>⭐️<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Rleshner\"><u>Robert Leshner</u></a>, CEO &amp; Co-founder of Superstate</p>\n<p>⭐️<a href=\"https://twitter.com/tarunchitra\"><u>Tarun Chitra</u></a>, Managing Partner at Robot Ventures</p>\n<p>⭐️<a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomhschmidt\"><u>Tom Schmidt</u></a>, General Partner at Dragonfly </p>\n<p><br></p>\nLinks\n<p>Ken Chan’s “I Wasted 8 Years of My Life in Crypto”</p>\n<p>🔗 <a href=\"https://x.com/kenchangh/status/1994854381267947640\"><u>https://x.com/kenchangh/status/1994854381267947640</u></a> </p>\n<p>Tarun Chitra’s Autodeleveraging: $653 million lost to a greedy heuristic?</p>\n<p>🔗 <a href=\"https://x.com/kenchangh/status/1994854381267947640\"><u>https://x.com/kenchangh/status/1994854381267947640</u></a> </p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br><a href=\"http://choppingblock.xyz\"><u>Disclosures</u></a><br></p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

In this episode, Ryan and David sit down with Davide Crapis and Austin Griffith to map the emerging agent stack: ERC-8004 as a decentralized identity + reputation layer, x402 as payment rails for agent-to-agent commerce, and the real-world “Clawdbot” experiments that show what happens when an agent gets a wallet, a codebase, and a mandate. Along the way: prompt-injection risks, why agents read calldata like it’s their native language, and why it may be the best time in history to be a solo builder—even as it gets harder to be a junior dev.<br></p><p class=\"text-node\">---</p><p class=\"text-node\">📣SPOTIFY PREMIUM RSS FEED | USE CODE: SPOTIFY24<br><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://bankless.cc/spotify-premium\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://bankless.cc/spotify-premium</a><br></p><p class=\"text-node\">---<br>🔮POLYMARKET | #1 PREDICTION MARKET<br><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://bankless.cc/polymarket-podcast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://bankless.cc/polymarket-podcast</a><br></p><p class=\"text-node\">🃏SHOWDOWN | NEXT-GEN POKER<br><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://bankless.cc/showdown\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://bankless.cc/showdown</a><br></p><p class=\"text-node\">🏅BITGET TRADFI | TRADE GOLD WITH USDT<br><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://bankless.cc/bitget\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://bankless.cc/bitget</a><br></p><p class=\"text-node\">👑BANKLESS PREMIUM | AD-FREE &amp; BONUS EPISODES<br><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://bankless.cc/spotify-premium\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://bankless.cc/spotify-premium</a><br></p><p class=\"text-node\">🎯THE DEFI REPORT | ONCHAIN INSIGHTS<br><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://bankless.cc/TDR-pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://bankless.cc/TDR-pro</a><br></p><p class=\"text-node\">💰ICO WATCH | UPCOMING PUBLIC TOKEN SALES<br><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://bankless.cc/ico-watch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://bankless.cc/ico-watch</a><br></p><p class=\"text-node\">---<br>TIMESTAMPS<br></p><p class=\"text-node\">0:00 “AI is the new UI,” and you’ll be talking to your wallet<br>4:09 Is there an arms race for AI activity across chains?<br>7:32 The Clawdbot/OpenClaw moment: agents get OS-level power<br>13:18 Why crypto is native to agents<br>19:41 Austin’s setup: Claude bot, heartbeat loops, and real autonomy<br>22:28 The token incident: how a bot “got a treasury”<br>28:46 Prompt injection meets wallets<br>38:20 ERC-8004 explained: identity, reputation, validation<br>40:35 x402 + 8004: discovery + payment rails for agent commerce<br>48:38 8004 “scans” and early adoption reality<br>1:05:32 What agents could build when they can hire other agents<br>1:12:38 Tooling for the new builder era: Speedrun → Wingman<br>1:25:23 “Worst time to be a junior dev…”<br>1:28:15 Predictions: clean English becomes the sign of AI<br></p><p class=\"text-node\">---<br>RESOURCES<br></p><p class=\"text-node\">Austin Griffith<br><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://x.com/austingriffith\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://x.com/austingriffith</a><br></p><p class=\"text-node\">Davide Crapis<br><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://x.com/DavideCrapis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://x.com/DavideCrapis</a><br></p><p class=\"text-node\">---<br>Not financial or tax advice.

This episode opens with the Aave DAO civil war: a CoWSwap integration that allegedly routed swap fees to Aave Labs/Avara instead of the DAO, igniting “stealth privatization” claims, a “poison pill” push to seize Aave IP/brand, and a bigger fight over who really owns Aave.com and the protocol’s front door.</p>\n<p>Next, the crew unpacks the Flow hack (a $3.9M mint exploit) and the wild rollback talk that followed — plus why forks and bridges make rollbacks dangerous, turning bridges into accidental custodians and breaking old security assumptions.</p>\n<p>Finally, they break down Coinbase’s System Update and the “Everything Exchange” strategy — stocks, tokenization, perps, prediction markets, stablecoin rails — and whether this approach can win against Robinhood.

After six months of intensive research and discussions with Nobel Prize-winning physicists, Nic breaks down why the \"quantum threat\" has moved from theoretical FUD to a material risk that the Bitcoin community is currently unprepared to face.They explore the \"Q-Day\" timeline, the vulnerability of Satoshi’s 2 million BTC, and the urgent need for a migration to post-quantum cryptography. Can Bitcoin’s rigid governance survive the most significant technical challenge in its history, or will sovereign nations and private firms reach the coins first?🎯 Key Highlights▸Why Nic stepped away from podcasts and TV to focus on precise technical writing.▸The 2025 Quantum Inflection: Why 2025 was a record year for quantum investment.▸The Trillion Dollar Bug Bounty: The \"unsolvable\" problem of Satoshi’s P2PK addresses.▸Why Bitcoin developers implemented Taproot without making it quantum-resistant.▸Defense in Depth for BTC: The technical hurdles of implementing post-quantum signature schemes and the potential for a mandatory \"migration\" period.▸How the U.S.–China rivalry mirrors the 1939 race for the atomic bomb.▸Applying maritime law to the potential \"theft\" of ancient Bitcoins by private firms like IBM or Microsoft.▸Scoring the Bitcoin core developers’ preparedness at a 1/100.💡 Want to stay updated with the latest in crypto &amp; AI?

                    "description": "<p>Join Tommy Shaughnessy as he speaks with Logan, Managing Partner of Frictionless Capital, about the high-stakes race to build a global blockchain-based financial system. Logan shares his updated thesis on why monolithic, high-throughput architectures like Solana are winning the battle for real revenue and trading dominance over modular designs.They dive deep into the &quot;Global Exchange&quot; vision, the physics of time-to-inclusion, and how innovations like Proprietary AMMs (PropAMMs) are redefining market making. Logan also explores the broader implications of AI, from the compounding power of Grok to the societal impact of a robot-led workforce.🎯 Key Highlights▸Analyzing the Frictionless chart showing that crypto apps on Solana are the fastest to reach $100M in revenue globally.▸ Why Logan remains bearish on the &quot;incorrect&quot; modular design and Layer 2 scaling solutions. ▸ How the speed of light and server location prevent current centralized exchanges from being truly global. ▸ A look at the next engineering frontier. ▸ The &quot;crypto-native&quot; evolution of order books that uses massive Oracle updates to eliminate stale quotes. ▸ Why Logan believes the market will split into either fully regulated exchanges or fully decentralized global engines. ▸ Why Elon Musk&#39;s Grok is positioned to be the smartest model over time. ▸ The &quot;freaky&quot; transition to humanoid automation and the potential for a 20-day &quot;atom-moving&quot; data center revolution.💡 Want to stay updated with the latest in crypto &amp; AI?

This week, the crew dives deep into Venezuela's unexpected crypto connections following Maduro's capture, unpacking how the YC-backed fintech Kontigo allegedly used stablecoins to arbitrage sanctions and capital controls.</p> <p>They debate the moral complexities of banking the unbanked versus violating US sanctions, and whether stablecoins are fulfilling their promise of financial freedom or enabling bad actors. The conversation then shifts to prediction markets drama, as a mysterious trader made $400k betting on Maduro's downfall just hours before it happened — sparking calls for insider trading laws in political betting markets.</p> <p>Finally, they tackle the governance chaos in Zcash land, where the entire Electric Coin Company team quit en masse over disagreements with the nonprofit board, launching a new for-profit venture called CashZ. The hosts debate whether this signals the end of the foundation era in crypto, or just growing pains for protocols trying to build killer products.</p> <p><strong>Hosts:</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hosseeb\"><u>Haseeb Qureshi</u></a></li> </ul> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Rleshner\"><u>Robert Leshner</u></a></li> </ul> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/tarunchitra\"><u>Tarun Chitra</u></a></li> </ul> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomhschmidt\"><u>Tom Schmidt</u></a></li> </ul> <p><strong>Links:</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://fintechbusinessweekly.substack.com/p/kontigo-ycombinators-venezuela-sanctions\"><u>FinTech Business Weekly - Kontigo: Y Combinator's Venezuelan Sanctions Evasion Startup</u></a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/americas/maduro-polymarket-bet-a2e5d100\"><u>Wall Street Journal - A Mystery Trader Made $400,000 Betting on Maduro’s Downfall</u></a></li> </ul><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

Classics are my favorite episodes from the past 10 years, published once a month. These are N of 1 conversations with N of 1 people.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/RicElias\"><u>Ric Elias</u></a> is the CEO and co-founder of Red Ventures, which has a portfolio of fast-growing digital businesses like Lonely Planet, The Points Guy, Bankrate, and large investments in a variety of other businesses across industries. He began the business in 2000 and has grown it to now a global company with thousands of employees. </p>\n<p>Ric walks us through the early struggles that have led to what is now a flourishing investing platform, but mostly this episode is a masterclass on cultural values and philosophies that transcend mere financial gain. We discuss the difference between living good and well, the power of forgiveness, and compounding more than just your capital. Ric’s story is one of resilience, humility, and grace. His story about being in the front row of the plane that Captain Sully landed in the Hudson is singular and very moving. </p>\n<p>Please enjoy my conversation with Ric Elias.</p>\n<p>For the full show notes, transcript, and links to mentioned content, check out the episode page<a href=\"https://joincolossus.com/episode/ric-elias-the-art-of-living-well/\"><u> here.</u></a></p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>This episode is brought to you by <a href=\"https://workos.com/\"><u>WorkOS</u></a>.

He explains that your mitochondria don’t just “make energy”; they translate what you do—your mindset and your relationships—into the energy you experience as vitality or lack thereof. He explains how exercise, nutrition, sleep, meditation, and even certain thought patterns and our sense of purpose can charge our cells like batteries. He also shares findings that hair greying is the result of cellular stress and is reversible.

Her central insight is that babies learn like scientists, running experiments and updating beliefs based on evidence. But Tyler wonders: are scientists actually good learners? It's a question that leads them into a wide-ranging conversation about what we've been systematically underestimating in young minds, what's wrong with simple nature-versus-nurture frameworks, and whether AI represents genuine intelligence or just a very sophisticated library.</p> <p class=\"font-claude-response-body\">Tyler and Alison cover how children systematically experiment on the world and what study she'd run with $100 million, why babies are more conscious than adults and what consciousness even means, episodic memory and aphantasia, whether Freud got anything right about childhood and what's held up best from Piaget, how we should teach young children versus school-age kids, how AI should change K-12 education and Gopnik's case that it's a cultural technology rather than intelligence, whether the enterprise of twin studies makes sense and why she sees nature versus nurture as the wrong framework entirely, autism and ADHD as diagnostic categories, whether the success of her siblings belies her skepticism about genetic inheritance, her new project on the economics and philosophy of caregiving, and more.</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><em>Read a <a href= \"https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/alison-gopnik/\">full transcript</a> enhanced with helpful links, or watch the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIFdeXPB1Pg\">full video</a> on the new dedicated Conversations with Tyler channel.</em></p> <p class=\"p1\"><em>Recorded October 30th, 2025</em><em>.</em></p> <p class=\"p1\"> Other ways to connect</p> <ul> <li class=\"p1\" style= \"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Follow us on <a href= \"https://twitter.com/cowenconvos\">X</a> and <a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/cowenconvos/?hl=en\">Instagram</a></li> <li class=\"p1\" style= \"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tylercowen\">Tyler</a> on X</li> <li class=\"p1\" style= \"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Follow <a href=\"https://x.com/AlisonGopnik\">Alison</a> on X</li> <li style= \"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> <a class=\"c-link\" href=\"https://mercatus.tfaforms.net/5060931\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\" data-stringify-link=\"https://www.tfaforms.com/5060931\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">Sign up for our newsletter</a></li> <li style= \"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Join our <a href= \"https://discord.gg/JAVWP7vTxt\">Discord</a></li> <li class=\"p1\" style= \"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Email us: <a class=\"c-link\" tabindex=\"-1\" href= \"mailto:cowenconvos@mercatus.gmu.edu\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"mailto:cowenconvos@mercatus.gmu.edu\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\" aria-haspopup=\"menu\" aria-expanded=\"false\" data-remove-tab-index= \"true\">cowenconvos@mercatus.gmu.edu</a></li> <li class=\"p1\" style= \"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Learn more about Conversations with Tyler and other Mercatus Center podcasts <a href= \"https://www.mercatus.org/podcasts\">here</a>.</li> </ul> <p>Timestamps</p> <p>00:00:00 - How children—and scientists—learn</p> <p>00:14:35 - Consciousness, episodic memories, and aphantasia</p> <p>00:23:06 - Freud's and Piaget's theories about childhood</p> <p>00:27:49 - Twin studies and nature vs. nurture</p> <p>00:39:33 - Teaching strategies for younger vs. older children</p> <p>00:44:07 - AI's ability to generate novel insights</p> <p>00:53:57 - What Autism and ADHD diagnoses do and don't reveal</p> <p>00:58:02 - The success of the Gopnik siblings</p> <p>Photo Credit: Rod Searcey</p>",

Known for her practical, psychology-based approach to parenting, Dr. Becky shares how the same principles that help parents raise resilient children can make you a much more effective leader. In this conversation, she breaks down why all human systems—whether families or companies—operate on the same fundamental principles, and how understanding these dynamics can make you more effective in every relationship.</p><p></p><p><strong>We discuss:</strong></p><p>1. Why repair—not perfection—defines strong leadership</p><p>2. Why you need to connect before you correct to build cooperation and trust</p><p>3. The “most generous interpretation” framework for handling difficult behaviors</p><p>4. How to correctly set boundaries (vs. making requests)</p><p>5. The power of “I believe you, and I believe in you”</p><p>6. What it looks like to be a “sturdy” leader</p><p>—</p><p><strong>Brought to you by:</strong></p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://merge.dev/lenny\"><strong>Merge</strong></a>—Fast, secure

This work includes his award-winning Cranmer biography, his sweeping histories of Christianity and the Reformation, and his latest on sex and the church, which demonstrates what MacCulloch calls the historian's true vocation: unsettling settled facts to keep humanity sane.</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style= \"margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: normal;\"> Tyler and Diarmaid explore whether monotheism correlates with monogamy, Christianity's early instinct towards egalitarianism, what the Eucharistic revolution reveals about the cathedral building boom, the role of Mary in Christianity and Islam, where Michel Foucault went wrong on sexuality, the significance of the clerical family replacing the celibate monk, why Elizabeth I—not Henry VIII—mattered most for the English Reformation, why English Renaissance music began so brilliantly but then needed to start importing Germans, whether Christianity needs hell to survive, what MacCulloch plans to do next, and more.</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><em>Read a <a href= \"https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/diarmaid-macculloch/\">full transcript</a> enhanced with helpful links, or watch the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/zld39xD4sus\">full vi</a><a href= \"https://youtu.be/VeDKWf80Z3M\">deo</a> on the new dedicated Conversations with Tyler channel.</em></p> <p class=\"p1\"><em>Recorded October 29th, 2025</em><em>.</em></p> <p class=\"p1\"><em>This episode was made possible through the support of the John Templeton Foundation.</em></p> <p class=\"p1\"> Other ways to connect</p> <ul> <li class=\"p1\" style= \"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Follow us on <a href= \"https://twitter.com/cowenconvos\">X</a> and <a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/cowenconvos/?hl=en\">Instagram</a></li> <li class=\"p1\" style= \"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tylercowen\">Tyler</a> on X</li> <li style= \"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> <a class=\"c-link\" href=\"https://mercatus.tfaforms.net/5060931\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\" data-stringify-link=\"https://www.tfaforms.com/5060931\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">Sign up for our newsletter</a></li> <li style= \"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Join our <a href= \"https://discord.gg/JAVWP7vTxt\">Discord</a></li> <li class=\"p1\" style= \"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Email us: <a class=\"c-link\" tabindex=\"-1\" href= \"mailto:cowenconvos@mercatus.gmu.edu\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"mailto:cowenconvos@mercatus.gmu.edu\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\" aria-haspopup=\"menu\" aria-expanded=\"false\" data-remove-tab-index= \"true\">cowenconvos@mercatus.gmu.edu</a></li> <li class=\"p1\" style= \"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Learn more about Conversations with Tyler and other Mercatus Center podcasts <a href= \"https://www.mercatus.org/podcasts\">here</a>.</li> </ul> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><em> Image Credit: Barry Jones</em></p>",

In this episode, Reid and Aria chat with comedian, actor, and political commentator Stephen Colbert. Best known for hosting The Colbert Report and The Late Show, Stephen combines a razor sharp satire with a sincere curiosity about the world. Together, Reid, Aria, and Stephen discuss the art of live performance, the many lessons one can learn from J.R.R. Tolkien, and the nature of creativity, humor, and imagination in the age of AI. The result is a meditation on discovery, empathy, and the bonds that make connection more than performance — but a shared act of being human.</p>",

Gavin is the managing partner and CIO of Atreides Management, and he has been on the show many times before. </p>\n<p>I will never forget when I first met Gavin in 2017. I find his interest in markets, his curiosity about the world to be as infectious as any investor that I've ever come across. He's encyclopedic on what is going on in the world of technology today, and I've had the good fortune to host him every year or two on this podcast.</p>\n<p>Gavin began covering Nvidia as an investor more than two decades ago, giving him a rare perspective on how the company – and the entire semiconductor ecosystem – has evolved. A lot has changed since our <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/05Fx7yNSEA148kHr1znbrb\"><u>last conversation</u></a> a year ago, making this the perfect time to revisit the topic.</p>\n<p>In this conversation, we talk about everything that interests Gavin – Nvidia’s GPUs, Google’s TPUs, the changing AI landscape, the math and business models around AI companies and everything in between. We also discussed the idea of data centers in space, which he communicates with his usual passion and logic.</p>\n<p>In closing, at the end of this conversation, because I've asked him my traditional closing question before, I asked him a different question, which led to a discussion of his entire investing origin story that I had never heard before.</p>\n<p>Because Gavin is one of the most passionate thinkers and investors that I know, these conversations are always amongst my most favorite. I hope you enjoy this latest in the series of discussions with Gavin Baker.</p>\n<p>For the full show notes, transcript, and links to mentioned content, check out the episode page <a href=\"https://joincolossus.com/episode/nvidia-v-google-%E2%80%A6-economics-of-ai/\"><u>⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠here⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠</u></a><u>.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠</u></p>\n<p><strong>-----</strong></p>\n<p><strong>This episode is brought to you by</strong>⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠<strong> </strong><a href=\"http://ramp.com/invest\"><strong>Ramp</strong><u>⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠</u></a><strong>.

Henry has spent his career studying the rare 1% of companies that drive nearly all long-term returns .

I always hear the same thing from founders who’ve met Henry: “he understood my business faster than anyone”.

Bitcoin, meanwhile, has struggled to keep pace, raising uncomfortable questions about its “digital gold” narrative.</p>\n<p>In this <strong>back-to-back Unchained episode</strong>, <strong>Vinny Lingham</strong>, cofounder of Xash, and <strong>Eric Fine</strong>, portfolio manager at <strong>VanEck</strong>, offer two distinct but complementary perspectives on what’s happening beneath the surface of global markets.</p>\n<p>Vinny explains why gold’s liquidity, trust, and central-bank adoption still dwarf Bitcoin’s, and why that gap led him to design a gold-backed, reward-bearing stablecoin, USDX.</p>\n<p>Eric walks through VanEck’s provocative analysis showing gold could reach <strong>$39,000 or even $184,000</strong> if the dollar were to lose its reserve-currency dominance and gold had to back the money supply. He also dives into why some developed markets may be more fragile than investors assume.</p>\n<p><strong>Guests:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n<a href=\"https://x.com/VinnyLingham\"><u>Vinny Lingham</u></a>, Co-founder, and President of Xash</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n<a href=\"https://x.com/EricFine123\"><u>Eric Fine</u></a>, Portfolio Manager, Active Emerging Markets Debt at VanEck</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Links:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://unchainedcrypto.com/why-gold-and-bitcoin-work-best-together/\"><u>Why Gold and Bitcoin Work Best Together</u></a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://unchainedcrypto.com/why-bitcoin-is-tanking-despite-gold-reaching-high-after-high/\"><u>Why Bitcoin Is Tanking Despite Gold Reaching High After High</u></a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://unchainedcrypto.com/how-venezuela-shows-why-bitcoin-crypto-and-stablecoins-help-everyday-people/\"><u>How Venezuela Shows Why Bitcoin, Crypto and Stablecoins Help Everyday People</u></a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://unchainedcrypto.com/bitcoin-rallies-to-93000-after-u-s-attack-on-venezuela/\"><u>Bitcoin Rallies to $93,000 After U.S. Attack on Venezuela</u></a></li>\n</ul><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

Nick previously spent two decades leading JP Morgan's emerging markets business across multiple cycles and served on the bank's Executive Committee. He also served as the founding chair of the Emerging Market Traders Association and later as chair of the Emerging Markets Private Equity Association.</p> <p> Nick's worldview is also shaped by his international family history of doing well while doing good. His grandfather, Clarence Streit, was a longtime New York Times foreign correspondent, and his father, Felix Rohatyn, was one of the most influential financiers of his generation.</p> <p> Our conversation traces Nick's path from his international upbringing to capital markets innovation at JP Morgan and the founding of TRG. We discuss his multi-asset class, horizontal investment approach to emerging markets, problems of emerging market benchmarks, necessity of diversification in surviving volatile cycles, importance of currency management, and value of creating scale through acquisitions. We close with Nick's views on the opportunity ahead and his ambition to build a leading global, multi-asset class emerging markets firm.</p> <p> Learn More Follow Ted on Twitter at <a href= \"https://twitter.com/tseides?lang=en\">@tseides</a> or <a href= \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tedseides/\">LinkedIn</a> Subscribe to the <a href=\"https://capitalallocators.com/\">mailing list</a> Access Transcript with <a href= \"https://capitalallocators.com/signup\">Premium Membership</a></p> <p> </p> <em>Editing and post-production work for this episode was provided by The Podcast Consultant (</em><a title= \"https://thepodcastconsultant.com/\" href= \"https://thepodcastconsultant.com/\">⁠</a><a title= \"https://thepodcastconsultant.com/\" href= \"https://thepodcastconsultant.com/\">https://thepodcastconsultant.com</a><a title=\"https://thepodcastconsultant.com/\" href=\"https://thepodcastconsultant.com/\">⁠</a><em>)</em>",

And it's really all metals. The ultimate industrial metal, copper, has been on a massive tear, but so has gold, which has very few industrial uses. And then, of course, silver has seen a blistering rally, in part due to massive buying in China. On this episode, we bring back the man who saw this coming years ago, Carlyle partner Jeff Currie. Prior to joining Carlyle, Currie was a top commodities analyst at Goldman Sachs, and has been calling for the emergence of a brand new supercycle for years now. In this episode, he explains the drivers of this supercycle, and why he thinks we're in the very early days of what will be a multi-year run.</p> <p data-prosemirror-content-type=\"node\" data-prosemirror-node-name=\"paragraph\" data-prosemirror-node-block=\"true\">Read more:<br data-prosemirror-content-type=\"node\" data-prosemirror-node-name=\"hardBreak\" data-prosemirror-node-inline=\"true\"><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-29/gold-retreats-from-record-above-5-500-as-rally-momentum-slows?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=podcast&amp;utm_campaign=odd_lots&amp;utm_content=article\" data-prosemirror-content-type=\"mark\" data-prosemirror-mark-name=\"link\">Gold Retreats in Sudden Selloff After Breaking Through $5,500</a><br data-prosemirror-content-type=\"node\" data-prosemirror-node-name=\"hardBreak\" data-prosemirror-node-inline=\"true\"><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-29/copper-rallies-to-record-on-lme-as-base-metals-extend-bull-run?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=podcast&amp;utm_campaign=odd_lots&amp;utm_content=article\" data-prosemirror-content-type=\"mark\" data-prosemirror-mark-name=\"link\">China&rsquo;s Metals Mania Sends Copper Soaring Past $14,500 a Ton</a></p> <p data-prosemirror-content-type=\"node\" data-prosemirror-node-name=\"paragraph\" data-prosemirror-node-block=\"true\">Only <a href=\"http://Bloomberg.com\" data-inline-card=\"\" data-card-data=\"\">http://Bloomberg.com</a> subscribers can get the Odd Lots newsletter in their inbox each week, plus unlimited access to the site and app. Subscribe at&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/subscriptions/oddlots?in_source=oddlotspodcast\" data-prosemirror-content-type=\"mark\" data-prosemirror-mark-name=\"link\">bloomberg.com/subscriptions/oddlots</a></p> <p data-prosemirror-content-type=\"node\" data-prosemirror-node-name=\"paragraph\" data-prosemirror-node-block=\"true\"><a href=\"http://bloomberg.com/subscriptions/oddlots\" data-prosemirror-content-type=\"mark\" data-prosemirror-mark-name=\"link\">Subscribe to the Odd Lots Newsletter</a><br data-prosemirror-content-type=\"node\" data-prosemirror-node-name=\"hardBreak\" data-prosemirror-node-inline=\"true\"><strong data-prosemirror-content-type=\"mark\" data-prosemirror-mark-name=\"strong\">Join the conversation:</strong> <a href=\"https://discord.gg/oddlots\" data-prosemirror-content-type=\"mark\" data-prosemirror-mark-name=\"link\">discord.gg/oddlots</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",

When people or companies use AI to break the law, existing criminal, civil rights, consumer protection, and antitrust frameworks should still apply. Enforcement agencies should have the resources they need to enforce the law. If existing bodies of law fall short in accounting for certain AI use cases, any new laws should be evidence-based, clearly defining marginal risks and the optimal approach to target harms directly. </p><p>In this conversation, we go deeper on what that principle means in practice with Martin Casado, general partner at a16z where he leads the firm’s infrastructure practice and invests in advanced AI systems and foundational compute. Martin has lived through multiple platform shifts–as a researcher where he worked on large-scale simulations for the Department of Defense before working with the intelligence community on networking and cybersecurity, a pioneer of software-defined networking at Stanford, and the cofounder and CTO of Nicira, which was acquired by VMware–giving him a rare perspective on how breakthrough technologies are governed as they develop and scale. </p><p>Martin joins Jai Ramaswamy and Matt Perault to discuss how decades of technology policy can inform addressing harmful uses of AI, defining marginal risk in AI, the importance of open source for long-term competitiveness, and more. </p><p> </p><p>Follow Jai Ramaswamy on X:<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jai_ramaswamy\"> https://twitter.com/jai_ramaswamy</a></p><p>Follow Matt Perault on X:<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MattPerault\"> https://twitter.com/MattPerault</a></p><p>Follow Martin Casado on X:<a href=\"https://x.com/martin_casado\"> https://twitter.com/martin_casado</a></p><p>Read the a16z AI Policy Brief here: <a href=\"https://a16zpolicy.substack.com/\">https://a16zpolicy.substack.com/</a></p>\n<p><p>Check out everything a16z is doing with artificial intelligence <a href=\"https://a16z.com/ai/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, including articles, projects, and more podcasts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Please note that the content here is for informational purposes only; should NOT be taken as legal, business, tax, or investment advice or be used to evaluate any investment or security; and is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any a16z fund. a16z and its affiliates may maintain investments in the companies discussed.

It’s a sprawling set of contracts for both existing plants and next-generation reactors that totals 6.6 gigawatts.</p>\n<p>Just a few years ago, the conversation in the U.S. was about which nuclear plants were going to shut down next. Now, some of the world’s largest technology companies are trying to lock them up under long-term contracts, while building new ones.</p>\n<p>But critics argue that parts of Meta’s deal don’t add new capacity fast enough — possibly pushing electricity prices even higher in an already-tight market.</p>\n<p>And that concern is suddenly political. This week, President Trump said tech companies need to pay their own way when it comes to electricity, signaling just how central data centers are to the national debate over affordability.</p>\n<p>This week, we have a breakdown of Meta’s nuclear push. We’ll look at what it means for power markets, how it compares to what the rest of the hyperscalers are doing, and whether this moment actually changes the future of advanced nuclear.</p>\n<p><em>Credits: Co-hosted by Stephen Lacey, Jigar Shah, and Caroline Golin.

Whether you call their orchestration virtual power plants, distributed power plants, or think both those descriptions suck, the reality is that there’s a convergence of technology and need for energy assets that can be deployed quickly.</p><p>No longer a cute side show (duh), DERs are being deployed at scale. This discussion brings together folks with the battle scars of early days of DER deployment who are leading the charge now that affordability and capacity constraints are the calling card of the day.

Sarah gives a “tour of the arguments” on what ultimately led to the Soviet Union’s collapse, diving into the role of the US, the Sino-Soviet border conflict, the oil bust, ethnic rebellions and even the Roman Catholic Church. As she points out, this is all particularly interesting as we find ourselves potentially at the beginning of another Cold War.</p><p>As we wrap up this lecture series, I want to take a moment to thank Sarah for doing this with me. It has been such a pleasure.</p><p>If you want more of her scholarship, I highly recommend checking out the books she’s written.

                    "description": "<p>Electricity affordability has become the defining energy issue of 2026.<strong> </strong>As policymakers scramble for solutions, two very different playbooks are taking shape.</p>\n<p>On one side, a blunt-force federal approach led by the Trump Administration that treats affordability like an emergency. Keep coal plants open. Force markets to change. Make large power users pay directly for new power plants through market interventions.</p>\n<p>On the other, a quieter, asset-light strategy is emerging at the state level. In places like Illinois, Virginia, and New Jersey, governors and legislatures are increasingly looking to virtual power plants to meet growing peaks and avoid overbuilding the grid.</p>\n<p>This week on <em>Open Circuit</em>, we break down these two paths. What actually lowers costs, and on what timelines?</p>\n<p>We start with the federal push to reshape PJM capacity markets and make big energy users pay for new supply. How would that actually work? Is it real market reform, or political signaling?</p>\n<p>Then we turn to the state level, where VPPs and distributed resources are increasingly central to affordability plans. We compare how Illinois, Virginia, and New Jersey are approaching the problem.</p>\n<p><em>Join Latitude Media, April 13-14, in San Francisco for Transition-AI 2026, our flagship event on the AI-energy infrastructure buildout.

And more importantly, what it signals about the SEC’s approach to crypto and privacy.</p>\n<p>With legacy financial institutions coming onchain, like JPMorgan and DTTC, they discuss how crypto can actually help prevent data breaches and have a better product for users and companies alike. </p>\n<p>Interestingly, Jill recounts how she lost $30,000 in an exploit involving crypto mixer Railgun and why she didn’t even try to hide it from regulators at the roundtable. </p>\n<p>Plus, was Do Kwon's sentence excessive?

                    "description": "<p>Global health programs faced major disruptions to their funding in 2025. Back in March, we published our <a href=\"https://givewell.transistor.fm/episodes/givewell-s-response-to-usaid-funding-cuts-march-19-2025\">first podcast episode</a> to share a timely snapshot of the immediate impacts caused by the foreign aid freeze and GiveWell’s initial response strategy. It was unclear whether and when funding would resume, and what the medium and long-term implications would be for life-saving programs. </p><p><br></p><p>Over the last year, GiveWell has drawn on almost two decades of cost-effectiveness research and analysis to assess the effects of this tumult in real time, identify gaps where funding could have exceptional impact, and prepare for future needs. We’ve made nearly $50 million in grants in direct response to funding cuts, as part of our expected total grantmaking of around $350 million for the year. </p><p><br></p><p>In our final episode of the year, GiveWell CEO and co-founder Elie Hassenfeld and Director of Research Teryn Maddox follow-up on their first podcast conversation to look back at GiveWell’s response: Where did we succeed? What did we get wrong? Where could we have done better? How did our response evolve? And what might all of this mean for the world and our work in 2026? </p><p><br></p><p>Elie and Teryn discuss:</p><ul><li><strong>Strengthening partnerships for better decision-making:</strong> GiveWell first focused on addressing urgent gaps in familiar, high-impact program areas like malaria prevention, where our existing partnerships provided timely information about programs with imminent funding needs. We also built new relationships in areas previously well-funded by the US government, such as HIV prevention and treatment, where we’d done little prior grantmaking.</li><li><strong>The current state of aid and emerging needs in the new year:</strong> Some funding was reinstated for certain life-saving areas like malaria prevention, but other areas faced larger cuts and future funding levels remain uncertain. In addition, changes in how aid is structured have created further ongoing uncertainty. We anticipate that needs will continue to emerge in areas like HIV prevention—particularly for key populations that may be deprioritized—even as promising new interventions become available. </li><li><strong>What we’ve learned and how we’re preparing for 2026:</strong> We discuss some of our successes—like funding guarantees that kept malaria prevention campaigns on track—and new modeling approaches we used. We’re drawing on lessons from that work and making learning grants in new areas, including HIV, family planning, and health systems strengthening, to position ourselves for potential future cuts. </li></ul><p><br></p><p>Read our <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2025/11/24/help-us-respond-uncertain-future-for-global-health/\">blog post</a> to learn more about our response to this year's aid cuts, visit the <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/all-grants-fund\">All Grants Fund</a> page to learn more about how you can support this work, and listen or <a href=\"https://givewell.transistor.fm/subscribe\">subscribe to our podcast</a> for our latest updates.</p><p><br></p><p><em>This episode was recorded on December 16, 2025 and represents our best understanding at that time.</em></p>",

It's a puzzling question: episodes are four hours long, they come out infrequently, and they usually don’t have guests or video. Hardly the standard-issue playbook for podcasting success! And yet well over a million smart, curious and exceedingly busy humans share their (your!) valuable time with us every month. Why? This is the exact paradox that has been rolling around in the head of Michael Lewis (yes, <em>that</em> Michael Lewis) since he found the show earlier this year.</p><p>So we asked Michael to be our guest \"interlocutor\" and share what <em>he</em> thinks is going on here, while we share ten lessons we've stolen (graciously) from companies we've studied and brought into Acquired itself. He takes us through the entire Acquired journey: how we started, why we've never hired anyone or raised money, how we pick episodes, what our business model actually is, why we focus on quality and enjoyment over maximizing enterprise value, and ultimately why we’re all — you, him, us — kindred spirits together. Oh, and just for fun, we recorded this episode where another special journey began — the garage where Google was founded.</p><p>Thank you for an incredible decade together… here's to the next one!</p><p><br><em>Thank-yous:</em></p><ul><li><em>First, to Google for loaning us the garage. The sawhorse table desk, PC and CRT monitor on display in the background were all Google originals courtesy of the Google Founders Collection at the Computer History Museum.

They also cover crypto, stablecoins, modern warfare, the U.S.–China technology race, AI and manufacturing, and frontiers like fusion and quantum computing—plus lessons from Oculus, the founding of Anduril, and how to build mission-driven teams.</p><p> </p><p>Resources:</p><p>Follow Palmer Luckey on X: <a href=\"https://x.com/PalmerLuckey\">https://twitter.com/PalmerLuckey</a></p><p>Follow Chris Dixon on X: <a href=\"https://x.com/cdixon\">https://twitter.com/cdixon</a></p><p> </p><p>Stay Updated:</p><p>If you enjoyed this episode, be sure to like, subscribe, and share with your friends!</p><p>Find a16z on X: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/a16z\">https://twitter.com/a16z</a></p><p>Find a16z on LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z</a></p><p>Listen to the a16z Podcast on Spotify: <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/5bC65RDvs3oxnLyqqvkUYX\">https://open.spotify.com/show/5bC65RDvs3oxnLyqqvkUYX</a></p><p>Listen to the a16z Podcast on Apple Podcasts: <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a16z-podcast/id842818711\">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a16z-podcast/id842818711</a></p><p>Follow our host: <a href=\"https://x.com/eriktorenberg\">https://x.com/eriktorenberg</a></p><p>Please note that the content here is for informational purposes only; should NOT be taken as legal, business, tax, or investment advice or be used to evaluate any investment or security; and is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any a16z fund. a16z and its affiliates may maintain investments in the companies discussed.

Pedro shares <strong>why Capital One paid up</strong>, why he believes the <strong>“exit” mental model is wrong</strong>, and how Brex stays <strong>founder-led</strong> with a <strong>“butterfly” operating model</strong> inside a <strong>$150B platform</strong> powered by <strong>$6B in marketing</strong> and <strong>$6B in R&amp;D</strong>.</p><p>We break down the <strong>full deal timeline</strong> (term sheet on <strong>Dec 22</strong>, announcement tied to <strong>Capital One’s Jan 22 earnings</strong>), the <strong>50/50 cash–equity structure</strong>, and why Capital One committed <strong>~$950M in integration + retention</strong> to accelerate Brex’s trajectory. Pedro also walks through <strong>Brex’s valuation reset</strong>—from a <strong>$12B peak</strong> to a <strong>~$4B employee repricing</strong>, and now a <strong>~13.4x gross profit acquisition multiple</strong> at the <strong>top end of fintech public comps</strong>.</p><p>Pedro also explains how <strong>Brex is staying in war mode</strong>—shifting its real competition from fintech peers to <strong>JPMorgan, Amex, and the largest U.S. banks</strong>. With Capital One’s scale behind it, Brex is aggressively pushing to <strong>win enterprise market share</strong>, out-execute legacy incumbents, and become the <strong>dominant financial platform for modern companies</strong>.</p><p><strong>Brex today serves 1 in 3 U.S. startups</strong>, supports <strong>300+ public companies</strong>, and powers spend for <strong>top AI labs</strong>—including <strong>TikTok, Toast, Robinhood, Anthropic, Zoom, DoorDash, and Canva</strong>. After closing, Brex is expected to become the <strong>#3 corporate card platform in the U.S.</strong>, accelerating <strong>enterprise expansion</strong>, <strong>AI agents</strong>, and next-generation <strong>financial automation</strong>.</p><p><strong>This may be the only full public, founder-level breakdown of a major M&amp;A deal ever shared right after signing.</strong> Hope you enjoy!<br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Pedro Franceschi: </strong><a href=\"https://x.com/pedroh96\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://x.com/pedroh96</a><strong>  </strong></p><p><strong>Molly O’Shea:</strong> <a href=\"https://x.com/MollySOShea\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://x.com/MollySOShea</a> </p><p><strong>Sourcery:</strong> ⁠<a href=\"https://x.com/sourceryy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://x.com/sourceryy</a> <br></p><p><br></p><p>𝐄𝐏𝐈𝐒𝐎𝐃𝐄 𝐋𝐈𝐍𝐊𝐒</p><p><br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/3a3omxYXqK4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://youtu.be/3a3omxYXqK4</a></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>𝐒𝐏𝐎𝐍𝐒𝐎𝐑𝐒</strong></p><p>• <a href=\"https://brex.com/sourcery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Brex</strong></a>—The modern finance platform, combining the world’s smartest corporate card with integrated expense management, banking, bill pay, &amp; travel. <a href=\"https://brex.com/sourcery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://brex.com/sourcery</a></p><p>• <a href=\"https://turing.com/sourcery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Turing</strong></a>—Turing delivers top-tier talent, data, and tools to help AI labs improve model performance—and enables enterprises to turn those models into powerful, production-ready systems. <a href=\"https://turing.com/sourcery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://turing.com/sourcery</a></p><p>• <a href=\"https://www.deel.com/sourcery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Deel</strong></a><strong>—</strong>Deel is the global people platform that helps startups hire, manage, pay, and equip anyone, anywhere.

Drawing on his journey from early software entrepreneur to leading a16z’s apps fund, Alex shared how high agency, deep historical understanding, and the ability to attract talent, capital, and customers separate great founders from the rest. He reflected on motivation beyond money, explaining why “revenge or redemption” often fuels the resilience required to push through the hardest moments of company building.</p><p> </p><p>Resources:</p><p>Follow Alex Rampell on X: <a href=\"https://x.com/arampell?lang=en\">https://twitter.com/arampell</a> <br />Follow John Coogan on X: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johncoogan\">https://twitter.com/johncoogan</a> <br />Follow Jordi Hays on X: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jordihays\">https://twitter.com/jordihays</a></p><p>Listen to more from TBPN: <a href=\"https://www.tbpn.com/\">https://www.tbpn.com/</a></p><p> </p><p>Stay Updated: </p><p>If you enjoyed this episode, be sure to like, subscribe, and share with your friends!</p><p>Find a16z on X: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/a16z\">https://twitter.com/a16z</a></p><p>Find a16z on LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z</a></p><p>Listen to the a16z Podcast on Spotify: <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/5bC65RDvs3oxnLyqqvkUYX\">https://open.spotify.com/show/5bC65RDvs3oxnLyqqvkUYX</a></p><p>Listen to the a16z Podcast on Apple Podcasts: <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a16z-podcast/id842818711\">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a16z-podcast/id842818711</a></p><p>Please note that the content here is for informational purposes only; should NOT be taken as legal, business, tax, or investment advice or be used to evaluate any investment or security; and is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any a16z fund. a16z and its affiliates may maintain investments in the companies discussed.

He outlines Anduril’s growth to roughly <strong>7,000 employees</strong>, <strong>$1B+ in revenue with continued YoY doubling</strong>, and a reported <strong>$30.5B valuation (too low?)</strong>, while addressing <strong>IPO speculation &amp; these wild “fake SPVs</strong>.”</p><p>The conversation covers geopolitical instability, production constraints in the U.S. defense industrial base, and how the nearly <strong>$1 trillion defense budget</strong> is actually allocated to personnel, infrastructure, and sustainment, rather than new procurement. Schimpf draws on leadership lessons from <strong>Palantir</strong>, highlighting creativity, high agency (“Artisty &amp; Meritocracy’), and long-term alignment with military needs.</p><p>Schimpf also explains Anduril’s expansion from early autonomous systems into a portfolio spanning <strong>autonomous aircraft, cruise missiles, electronic warfare, and networked sensing and command platforms</strong>, enabled by a shared software and hardware foundation built around <strong>Lattice</strong>. Emphasizing the company’s focus on a <strong>distributed, autonomous battlefield</strong> and the ability to rapidly field new capabilities.</p><p><strong>FWIW:</strong> Spending time on Anduril’s campus ahead of the final interview of the day offered such a strong view into the scale and complexity of the organization Brian is leading. Walking through the facility and meeting with the founding team made the scope of Anduril’s operations very real, but also highlighted just how complementary their skill sets are and how that translates into execution at scale. And with that, I have concluded that given the company’s growth, momentum, &amp; market position.. Anduril may still be undervalued.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Brian Schimpf: </strong><a href=\"https://x.com/SchimpfBrian\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://x.com/SchimpfBrian</a> </p><p><strong>Molly O’Shea:</strong> ⁠<a href=\"https://x.com/MollySOShea%E2%81%A0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://x.com/MollySOShea⁠</a></p><p><strong>Sourcery:</strong> ⁠<a href=\"https://x.com/sourceryvc%E2%81%A0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://x.com/sourceryvc</a></p><p><br></p><p>𝐄𝐏𝐈𝐒𝐎𝐃𝐄 𝐋𝐈𝐍𝐊𝐒</p><p>YouTube : <a href=\"https://youtu.be/P5dsb28UVec\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferer\">https://youtu.be/P5dsb28UVec</a><br></p><p><strong>𝐒𝐏𝐎𝐍𝐒𝐎𝐑𝐒</strong></p><p>• <a href=\"https://brex.com/sourcery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Brex</strong></a>—The modern finance platform, combining the world’s smartest corporate card with integrated expense management, banking, bill pay, &amp; travel. <a href=\"https://brex.com/sourcery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://brex.com/sourcery</a></p><p>• <a href=\"https://turing.com/sourcery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Turing</strong></a>—Turing delivers top-tier talent, data, and tools to help AI labs improve model performance—and enables enterprises to turn those models into powerful, production-ready systems. <a href=\"https://turing.com/sourcery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://turing.com/sourcery</a></p><p>• <a href=\"https://carta.com/sourcery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Carta</strong></a>—Carta connects founders, investors, and limited partners through software purpose-built for private capital.

The company operates on four continents, serves <strong>5,000+ hospitals and health facilities</strong>, and delivers food, retail, and healthcare products directly to customers’ homes in minutes. Zipline’s zero-emission aircraft have delivered <strong>more than 20 million items</strong> with no serious injuries and are saving <strong>10,000+ lives per year</strong> in the process.</p><p>In the U.S., Zipline is scaling at exceptional speed. U.S. deliveries have grown by approximately <strong>15% week over week for the last seven months</strong>, and Keller shares that Zipline now does <strong>more deliveries in the United States than the rest of the world combined</strong>. In Dallas, Zipline’s first site took <strong>10 weeks</strong> to reach 100 deliveries per day, while newer sites reached that same volume in just <strong>2 days</strong>—a clear signal the system is moving from early adoption to everyday infrastructure.</p><p>We also cover Zipline’s upcoming launches in <strong>Houston and Phoenix</strong>, where customers will soon be able to order tens of thousands of items with deliveries arriving in as little as <strong>10 minutes</strong>, Zipline’s vertically integrated manufacturing strategy, and why Keller believes autonomous, on-demand logistics will soon be the norm across multiple U.S. states.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Keller R.

If not, then it's just lack of imagination.”</li><li>“I have no doubts that AI capabilities are just going to increase more and more over the next few years. But even more important is this concept of how much are we even leveraging what AI can do today? I would say that we've not even used 1% of current capabilities of these models”</li><li>“If you're trying to be everything to everyone, then you just cannot compete with somebody who's focused on a smaller problem and going deep into that.”</li></ul><p>You can also listen to Arvind’s earlier episode here: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIH0Qp6d6bg&amp;list=PLRiWZFltuYPF8A6UGm74K2q29UwU-Kk9k&amp;index=96\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIH0Qp6d6bg&amp;list=PLRiWZFltuYPF8A6UGm74K2q29UwU-Kk9k&amp;index=96</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Guest: </strong>Arvind Jain, founder and CEO, Glean</p><p>​</p><p>Connect with Arvind Jain</p><p>X: <a href=\"https://x.com/jainarvind\">https://x.com/jainarvind</a></p><p>LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jain-arvind/\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/jain-arvind/</a></p><p><br></p><p>Connect with Joubin</p><p>X:<a href=\"https://x.com/Joubinmir\"> https://x.com/Joubinmir</a></p><p>LinkedIn:<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/joubin-mirzadegan-66186854/\"> https://www.linkedin.com/in/joubin-mirzadegan-66186854/</a></p><p>Email: <a href=\"grit@kleinerperkins.com\">grit@kleinerperkins.com</a></p><p>Follow on LinkedIn:<br><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/kpgrit\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/kpgrit</a></p><p>Follow on X:<br><a href=\"https://x.com/KPGrit\">https://x.com/KPGrit</a></p><p>​Learn more about Kleiner Perkins:<a href=\"https://www.kleinerperkins.com/\">https://www.kleinerperkins.com/</a></p>",

He began the business in 2000 and has grown it to now a global company with thousands of employees. </p>\n<p>Ric walks us through the early struggles that have led to what is now a flourishing investing platform, but mostly this episode is a masterclass on cultural values and philosophies that transcend mere financial gain. We discuss the difference between living good and well, the power of forgiveness, and compounding more than just your capital. Ric’s story is one of resilience, humility, and grace. His story about being in the front row of the plane that Captain Sully landed in the Hudson is singular and very moving. </p>\n<p>Please enjoy my conversation with Ric Elias.</p>\n<p>For the full show notes, transcript, and links to mentioned content, check out the episode page<a href=\"https://joincolossus.com/episode/ric-elias-the-art-of-living-well/\"><u> here.</u></a></p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>This episode is brought to you by <a href=\"https://workos.com/\"><u>WorkOS</u></a>.

Gavin is the managing partner and CIO of Atreides Management, and he has been on the show many times before. </p>\n<p>I will never forget when I first met Gavin in 2017. I find his interest in markets, his curiosity about the world to be as infectious as any investor that I've ever come across. He's encyclopedic on what is going on in the world of technology today, and I've had the good fortune to host him every year or two on this podcast.</p>\n<p>Gavin began covering Nvidia as an investor more than two decades ago, giving him a rare perspective on how the company – and the entire semiconductor ecosystem – has evolved. A lot has changed since our <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/05Fx7yNSEA148kHr1znbrb\"><u>last conversation</u></a> a year ago, making this the perfect time to revisit the topic.</p>\n<p>In this conversation, we talk about everything that interests Gavin – Nvidia’s GPUs, Google’s TPUs, the changing AI landscape, the math and business models around AI companies and everything in between. We also discussed the idea of data centers in space, which he communicates with his usual passion and logic.</p>\n<p>In closing, at the end of this conversation, because I've asked him my traditional closing question before, I asked him a different question, which led to a discussion of his entire investing origin story that I had never heard before.</p>\n<p>Because Gavin is one of the most passionate thinkers and investors that I know, these conversations are always amongst my most favorite. I hope you enjoy this latest in the series of discussions with Gavin Baker.</p>\n<p>For the full show notes, transcript, and links to mentioned content, check out the episode page <a href=\"https://joincolossus.com/episode/nvidia-v-google-%E2%80%A6-economics-of-ai/\"><u>⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠here⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠</u></a><u>.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠</u></p>\n<p><strong>-----</strong></p>\n<p><strong>This episode is brought to you by</strong>⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠<strong> </strong><a href=\"http://ramp.com/invest\"><strong>Ramp</strong><u>⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠</u></a><strong>.

They talk about what it takes to build hardware at scale, where the biggest technological bottlenecks are today, and why optimism is still warranted despite geopolitical turmoil and regulatory constraints. They also cover crypto, stablecoins, modern warfare, the U.S.–China technology race, AI and manufacturing, and frontiers like fusion and quantum computing—plus lessons from Oculus, the founding of Anduril, and how to build mission-driven teams.</p><p> </p><p>Resources:</p><p>Follow Palmer Luckey on X: <a href=\"https://x.com/PalmerLuckey\">https://twitter.com/PalmerLuckey</a></p><p>Follow Chris Dixon on X: <a href=\"https://x.com/cdixon\">https://twitter.com/cdixon</a></p><p> </p><p>Stay Updated:</p><p>If you enjoyed this episode, be sure to like, subscribe, and share with your friends!</p><p>Find a16z on X: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/a16z\">https://twitter.com/a16z</a></p><p>Find a16z on LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z</a></p><p>Listen to the a16z Podcast on Spotify: <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/5bC65RDvs3oxnLyqqvkUYX\">https://open.spotify.com/show/5bC65RDvs3oxnLyqqvkUYX</a></p><p>Listen to the a16z Podcast on Apple Podcasts: <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a16z-podcast/id842818711\">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a16z-podcast/id842818711</a></p><p>Follow our host: <a href=\"https://x.com/eriktorenberg\">https://x.com/eriktorenberg</a></p><p>Please note that the content here is for informational purposes only; should NOT be taken as legal, business, tax, or investment advice or be used to evaluate any investment or security; and is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any a16z fund. a16z and its affiliates may maintain investments in the companies discussed.

Jayshree explains how&nbsp;Arista&nbsp;powers the demanding networks behind today’s AI systems, why AI traffic is fundamentally different from anything that came before, and why power—not hardware—is now the biggest constraint. She reflects on&nbsp;Arista’s evolution from a small engineering team with zero revenue to a global leader, the culture that shaped its success, and her own path from electrical engineer to CEO. A candid and insightful conversation about leadership, innovation, and the future of networking in an AI-driven world.</p><p>In Good Company is hosted by Nicolai Tangen, CEO of Norges Bank Investment Management.

Yi Returns to dig into the inside story of the IMO effort and more!</p><p class=\"text-node\">We discuss:</p><ul class=\"list-node\"><li class=\"list-item-node\"><p class=\"text-node\">Yi's path: <strong>Brain → Reka → Google DeepMind → Reasoning and AGI team Singapore</strong>, leading model training for Gemini Deep Think and IMO Gold</p></li><li class=\"list-item-node\"><p class=\"text-node\">The <strong>IMO Gold story</strong>: four co-captains (Yi in Singapore, Jonathan in London, Jordan in Mountain View, and Tong leading the overall effort), training the checkpoint in ~1 week, live competition in Australia with professors punching in problems as they came out, and the tension of not knowing if they'd hit Gold until the human scores came in (because the Gold threshold is a percentile, not a fixed number)</p></li><li class=\"list-item-node\"><p class=\"text-node\">Why they <strong>threw away AlphaProof</strong>: \"If one model can't do it, can we get to AGI?\" The decision to abandon symbolic systems and bet on end-to-end Gemini with RL was bold and non-consensus</p></li><li class=\"list-item-node\"><p class=\"text-node\"><strong>On-policy vs. off-policy RL</strong>: off-policy is imitation learning (copying someone else's trajectory), on-policy is the model generating its own outputs, getting rewarded, and training on its own experience—\"humans learn by making mistakes, not by copying\"</p></li><li class=\"list-item-node\"><p class=\"text-node\">Why <strong>self-consistency and parallel thinking</strong> are fundamental: sampling multiple times, majority voting, LM judges, and internal verification are all forms of self-consistency that unlock reasoning beyond single-shot inference</p></li><li class=\"list-item-node\"><p class=\"text-node\">The <strong>data efficiency frontier</strong>: humans learn from 8 orders of magnitude less data than models, so where's the bug? Is it the architecture, the learning algorithm, backprop, off-policyness, or something else?</p></li><li class=\"list-item-node\"><p class=\"text-node\">Three schools of thought on <strong>world models</strong>: (1) Genie/spatial intelligence (video-based world models), (2) Yann LeCun's JEPA + FAIR's code world models (modeling internal execution state), (3) the amorphous \"resolution of possible worlds\" paradigm (curve-fitting to find the world model that best explains the data)</p></li><li class=\"list-item-node\"><p class=\"text-node\">Why <strong>AI coding crossed the threshold</strong>: Yi now runs a job, gets a bug, pastes it into Gemini, and relaunches without even reading the fix—\"the model is better than me at this\"</p></li><li class=\"list-item-node\"><p class=\"text-node\">The <strong>Pokémon benchmark</strong>: can models complete Pokédex by searching the web, synthesizing guides, and applying knowledge in a visual game state? \"Efficient search of novel idea space is interesting, but we're not even at the point where models can consistently apply knowledge they look up\"</p></li><li class=\"list-item-node\"><p class=\"text-node\"><strong>DSI and generative retrieval</strong>: re-imagining search as predicting document identifiers with semantic tokens, now deployed at YouTube (symmetric IDs for RecSys) and Spotify</p></li><li class=\"list-item-node\"><p class=\"text-node\">Why <strong>RecSys and IR feel like a different universe</strong>: \"modeling dynamics are strange, like gravity is different—you hit the shuttlecock and hear glass shatter, cause and effect are too far apart\"</p></li><li class=\"list-item-node\"><p class=\"text-node\">The <strong>closed lab advantage is increasing</strong>: the gap between frontier labs and open source is growing because ideas compound over time, and researchers keep finding new tricks that play well with everything built before</p></li><li class=\"list-item-node\"><p class=\"text-node\">Why <strong>ideas still matter</strong>: \"the last five years weren't just blind scaling—transformers, pre-training, RL, self-consistency, all had to play well together to get us here\"</p></li><li class=\"list-item-node\"><p class=\"text-node\"><strong>Gemini Singapore</strong>: hiring for RL and reasoning researchers, looking for track record in RL or exceptional achievement in coding competitions, and building a small, talent-dense team close to the frontier</p></li></ul><p class=\"text-node\">—</p><p class=\"text-node\">Yi Tay</p><ul class=\"list-node\"><li class=\"list-item-node\"><p class=\"text-node\">Google DeepMind: <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://deepmind.google\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://deepmind.google</a></p></li><li class=\"list-item-node\"><p class=\"text-node\">X: <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://x.com/YiTayML\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://x.com/YiTayML</a></p></li></ul><p class=\"text-node\"></p><p class=\"text-node\"><h3>Chapters</h3><ul><li><strong>00:00:00</strong> Introduction: Returning to Google DeepMind and the Singapore AGI Team</li><li><strong>00:04:52</strong> The Philosophy of On-Policy RL: Learning from Your Own Mistakes</li><li><strong>00:12:00</strong> IMO Gold Medal: The Journey from AlphaProof to End-to-End Gemini</li><li><strong>00:21:33</strong> Training IMO Cat: Four Captains Across Three Time Zones</li><li><strong>00:26:19</strong> Pokemon and Long-Horizon Reasoning: Beyond Academic Benchmarks</li><li><strong>00:36:29</strong> AI Coding Assistants: From Lazy to Actually Useful</li><li><strong>00:32:59</strong> Reasoning, Chain of Thought, and Latent Thinking</li><li><strong>00:44:46</strong> Is Attention All You Need?

The end of Moore’s Law—says NVIDIA President, Founder, and CEO Jensen Huang—makes the shift to accelerated computing inevitable, regardless of any talk of an AI “bubble.” Sarah Guo and Elad Gil are joined by Jensen Huang for a wide-ranging discussion on the state of artificial intelligence as we begin 2026. Jensen reflects on the biggest surprises of 2025, including the rapid improvements in reasoning, as well as the profitability of inference tokens. He also talks about why AI will increase productivity without necessarily taking away jobs, and how physical AI and robotics can help to solve labor shortages. Finally, Jensen shares his 2026 outlook, including why he’s optimistic about US-China relations, why open source remains essential for keeping the US competitive, and which sectors are due for their “ChatGPT moment.” </p>\n<p>Sign up for new podcasts every week.

It did not disappoint. The topic at hand is the emergence of electrostates, where electricity is the dominant energy input to a nation’s power and security. There is no question that China will likely be the first electrostate. In the first half of 2025 alone, for instance, it built about 250 GW of solar, more than twice as much solar capacity as the rest of the world combined (in May alone, it built an eye-popping 93 GW).</p><p>It’s not just about renewables build out. China owns and has mastered the electrotech stack, argues Impluse’s Sam D’amico, which includes lithium-ion batteries, magnets and electric motors, power electronics and embedded computing. But that doesn’t mean it’s not happening in the U.S. Here it is unsurprisingly messier, slower, and certainly hampered by our fossil fuel riches. Grab some popcorn for hot takes on how this plays out here and around the globe.</p><p>Speakers:</p><p>* Drew Baglino, Founder and CEO, Heron Power</p><p>* Tristan Doherty, Chief Product Officer, LG Energy Solution Vertech</p><p>* Sam D’Amico, Founder and CEO, Impulse</p><p>* Daan Walter, Principal, Ember Futures</p><p>* James McGinniss - Founder and CEO, David Energy</p> <br/><br/>This is a public episode.

Drawing on his journey from early software entrepreneur to leading a16z’s apps fund, Alex shared how high agency, deep historical understanding, and the ability to attract talent, capital, and customers separate great founders from the rest. He reflected on motivation beyond money, explaining why “revenge or redemption” often fuels the resilience required to push through the hardest moments of company building.</p><p> </p><p>Resources:</p><p>Follow Alex Rampell on X: <a href=\"https://x.com/arampell?lang=en\">https://twitter.com/arampell</a> <br />Follow John Coogan on X: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johncoogan\">https://twitter.com/johncoogan</a> <br />Follow Jordi Hays on X: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jordihays\">https://twitter.com/jordihays</a></p><p>Listen to more from TBPN: <a href=\"https://www.tbpn.com/\">https://www.tbpn.com/</a></p><p> </p><p>Stay Updated: </p><p>If you enjoyed this episode, be sure to like, subscribe, and share with your friends!</p><p>Find a16z on X: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/a16z\">https://twitter.com/a16z</a></p><p>Find a16z on LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z</a></p><p>Listen to the a16z Podcast on Spotify: <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/5bC65RDvs3oxnLyqqvkUYX\">https://open.spotify.com/show/5bC65RDvs3oxnLyqqvkUYX</a></p><p>Listen to the a16z Podcast on Apple Podcasts: <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a16z-podcast/id842818711\">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a16z-podcast/id842818711</a></p><p>Please note that the content here is for informational purposes only; should NOT be taken as legal, business, tax, or investment advice or be used to evaluate any investment or security; and is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any a16z fund. a16z and its affiliates may maintain investments in the companies discussed.

He walks through his core founder framework of backing people who can materialize talent, capital, and customers, and explains why the strongest companies often have “hostages,” not just customers.</p><p>The discussion also covers pricing risk, secondaries, moral hazard in private markets, and how AI is reshaping software, labor, and company formation.

Scott joined Apollo in 1996 as its 13th employee and has spent nearly three decades helping build the firm into nearly a trillion-dollar alternative asset manager and retirement powerhouse.</p> <p> Our conversation traces Apollo's evolution from a value-oriented private equity boutique to an integrated platform investing across the capital structure at scale. We discuss the firm's core philosophy of excess return per unit of risk, its post-GFC expansion into private credit and retirement services, and why origination—not capital—has become the key constraint on its growth.</p> <p> We also explore Scott's transition from dealmaker to firm-wide leader, touching on culture, incentives, communication, and governance. We close with Scott's perspective on today's credit environment, the convergence of public and private markets, and the risks and opportunities shaping the next phase of alternative investing.</p> <p> Learn More Follow Ted on Twitter at <a href= \"https://twitter.com/tseides?lang=en\">@tseides</a> or <a href= \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tedseides/\">LinkedIn</a> Subscribe to the <a href=\"https://capitalallocators.com/\">mailing list</a> Access Transcript with <a href= \"https://capitalallocators.com/signup\">Premium Membership</a></p>",

Pedro shares <strong>why Capital One paid up</strong>, why he believes the <strong>“exit” mental model is wrong</strong>, and how Brex stays <strong>founder-led</strong> with a <strong>“butterfly” operating model</strong> inside a <strong>$150B platform</strong> powered by <strong>$6B in marketing</strong> and <strong>$6B in R&amp;D</strong>.</p><p>We break down the <strong>full deal timeline</strong> (term sheet on <strong>Dec 22</strong>, announcement tied to <strong>Capital One’s Jan 22 earnings</strong>), the <strong>50/50 cash–equity structure</strong>, and why Capital One committed <strong>~$950M in integration + retention</strong> to accelerate Brex’s trajectory. Pedro also walks through <strong>Brex’s valuation reset</strong>—from a <strong>$12B peak</strong> to a <strong>~$4B employee repricing</strong>, and now a <strong>~13.4x gross profit acquisition multiple</strong> at the <strong>top end of fintech public comps</strong>.</p><p>Pedro also explains how <strong>Brex is staying in war mode</strong>—shifting its real competition from fintech peers to <strong>JPMorgan, Amex, and the largest U.S. banks</strong>. With Capital One’s scale behind it, Brex is aggressively pushing to <strong>win enterprise market share</strong>, out-execute legacy incumbents, and become the <strong>dominant financial platform for modern companies</strong>.</p><p><strong>Brex today serves 1 in 3 U.S. startups</strong>, supports <strong>300+ public companies</strong>, and powers spend for <strong>top AI labs</strong>—including <strong>TikTok, Toast, Robinhood, Anthropic, Zoom, DoorDash, and Canva</strong>. After closing, Brex is expected to become the <strong>#3 corporate card platform in the U.S.</strong>, accelerating <strong>enterprise expansion</strong>, <strong>AI agents</strong>, and next-generation <strong>financial automation</strong>.</p><p><strong>This may be the only full public, founder-level breakdown of a major M&amp;A deal ever shared right after signing.</strong> Hope you enjoy!<br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Pedro Franceschi: </strong><a href=\"https://x.com/pedroh96\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://x.com/pedroh96</a><strong>  </strong></p><p><strong>Molly O’Shea:</strong> <a href=\"https://x.com/MollySOShea\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://x.com/MollySOShea</a> </p><p><strong>Sourcery:</strong> ⁠<a href=\"https://x.com/sourceryy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://x.com/sourceryy</a> <br></p><p><br></p><p>𝐄𝐏𝐈𝐒𝐎𝐃𝐄 𝐋𝐈𝐍𝐊𝐒</p><p><br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/3a3omxYXqK4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://youtu.be/3a3omxYXqK4</a></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>𝐒𝐏𝐎𝐍𝐒𝐎𝐑𝐒</strong></p><p>• <a href=\"https://brex.com/sourcery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Brex</strong></a>—The modern finance platform, combining the world’s smartest corporate card with integrated expense management, banking, bill pay, &amp; travel. <a href=\"https://brex.com/sourcery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://brex.com/sourcery</a></p><p>• <a href=\"https://turing.com/sourcery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Turing</strong></a>—Turing delivers top-tier talent, data, and tools to help AI labs improve model performance—and enables enterprises to turn those models into powerful, production-ready systems. <a href=\"https://turing.com/sourcery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://turing.com/sourcery</a></p><p>• <a href=\"https://www.deel.com/sourcery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Deel</strong></a><strong>—</strong>Deel is the global people platform that helps startups hire, manage, pay, and equip anyone, anywhere.

David has been involved in backing many of the defining companies of this era and is now investing behind a new wave of AI startups.</p><p>This discussion goes deep into how the a16z growth practice operates: how the team hires and develops a “Yankees-level” culture, how investment decisions get made without traditional committees, and how they build long-term relationships with founders years before investing.</p><p>A major focus is AI. David talks through how the team is investing across the stack and why he believes this period could create some of the largest companies ever built.</p><p>He also walks through the models that guide his thinking: why markets often misprice consistent growth, what makes “pull” businesses so durable, why many important markets become winner-take-all, and what he’s learned from studying exceptional founders — especially the “technical terminators” he’s drawn to.</p><p> </p><p>Resources:</p><p>Follow Harry Stebbings on X: https://twitter.com/HarryStebbings</p><p>Follow David George on X: https://twitter.com/DavidGeorge83</p><p> </p><p>Stay Updated:</p><p>If you enjoyed this episode, be sure to like, subscribe, and share with your friends!</p><p>Find a16z on X: https://twitter.com/a16z</p><p>Find a16z on LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z</a></p><p>Listen to the a16z Podcast on Spotify: <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/5bC65RDvs3oxnLyqqvkUYX\">https://open.spotify.com/show/5bC65RDvs3oxnLyqqvkUYX</a></p><p>Listen to the a16z Podcast on Apple Podcasts: <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a16z-podcast/id842818711\">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a16z-podcast/id842818711</a></p><p>Please note that the content here is for informational purposes only; should NOT be taken as legal, business, tax, or investment advice or be used to evaluate any investment or security; and is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any a16z fund. a16z and its affiliates may maintain investments in the companies discussed.

They also dig into why boards matter, how platform teams can change what partners do day-to-day, and the difference between “heat-seeking” investing and conviction-driven company building, especially in sectors like AI and crypto.</p><p>Timecodes:</p><p>00:00 Introduction </p><p>01:05 Ben Horowitz & Marc Andreessen’s Partnership  </p><p>04:05 Building & Leading a16z  </p><p>07:16 Managing High-Powered VCs  </p><p>11:01 Boards, Governance & Founder Support  </p><p>15:36 Platform Services & Recruiting  </p><p>17:43 Scale vs. Concentration in Venture  </p><p>20:57 Why Venture Can Scale  </p><p>24:27 Platform Services: What Works and What Doesn’t  </p><p>27:50 The Real Value of Board Membership  </p><p>35:38 Media, Brand & Marketing Evolution  </p><p>41:32 The Future of Media & Journalism  </p><p>45:30 Limits on Venture Firm Size  </p><p>49:13 Winning vs. Picking Deals  </p><p>53:16 The Case Against Venture Scale  </p><p>55:49 Hiring Operators & Rethinking the VC Product</p><p><br />Resources:</p><p>Follow Ben on X: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bhorowitz\">https://twitter.com/bhorowitz</a></p><p>Follow Jack on X: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbGFmbVZMMHdSZVN3TURCSzNtV0ZJRnhwRXJLd3xBQ3Jtc0trVXI4U2UyZWVYTVkxX2gwU1pvRjFGQ05qNXVCTlkzVVBOUy1hQThTTXE3QWZZUjE4MVMtZDY4N0dOTkVOSXBiSFdlRllGZXFXZzFfTXRJNzcyRzhOLTN6end6ckRSMVljSERuTGFJSDliWDNwVFZCYw&q=https%3A%2F%2Fx.com%2Fjaltma&v=_OHeOZiij_M\">https://twitter.com/jaltma</a></p><p>Watch more from Uncapped: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbHh0SUp6SWxWUUgtYVF6eFlsQ25FZFV1WDBSUXxBQ3Jtc0tsVlhVZWRXNERHZm8tNnNtQ0xHNjA4WDRpb1ROMVc1VlBlellyWVJvOTB2UG5wZktfTkJ5aFhOck42V3cwQk5rWGNQTThOMlg0T19MekZmM2RoTWdoRnVnT3YxOGlmSzB1R1JFUllBQ3plLU9LNjRSdw&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.altcap.com%2F&v=_OHeOZiij_M\">https://www.altcap.com/</a></p><p> </p><p>Stay Updated:</p><p>If you enjoyed this episode, be sure to like, subscribe, and share with your friends!</p><p>Find a16z on X: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/a16z\">https://twitter.com/a16z</a></p><p>Find a16z on LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z</a></p><p>Listen to the a16z Podcast on Spotify: <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/5bC65RDvs3oxnLyqqvkUYX\">https://open.spotify.com/show/5bC65RDvs3oxnLyqqvkUYX</a></p><p>Listen to the a16z Podcast on Apple Podcasts: <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a16z-podcast/id842818711\">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a16z-podcast/id842818711</a></p><p>Please note that the content here is for informational purposes only; should NOT be taken as legal, business, tax, or investment advice or be used to evaluate any investment or security; and is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any a16z fund. a16z and its affiliates may maintain investments in the companies discussed.

                    "description": "<p>The a16z AI Apps team outlines how they are thinking about the AI application cycle and why they believe it represents the largest and fastest product shift in software to date. The conversation places AI in the context of prior platform waves, from PCs to cloud to mobile, and examines where adoption is already translating into real enterprise usage and revenue. They walk through three core investment themes: existing software categories becoming AI-native, new categories where software directly replaces labor, and applications built around proprietary data and closed-loop workflows. Using portfolio examples, the discussion shows how these models play out in practice and why defensibility, workflow ownership, and data moats matter more than novelty as AI applications scale.</p><p> </p><p>Resources:</p><p>Follow  Alex Rampell on X: <a href=\"https://x.com/arampell\">https://twitter.com/arampell</a></p><p>Follow Jen Kha on X:<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jkhamehl\"> https://twitter.com/jkhamehl</a></p><p>Follow David Haber on X: <a href=\"https://x.com/dhaber\">https://twitter.com/dhaber</a></p><p>Follow Anish Acharya on X: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/illscience\">https://twitter.com/illscience</a></p><p> </p><p>Stay Updated:</p><p>If you enjoyed this episode, be sure to like, subscribe, and share with your friends!</p><p>Find a16z on X: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/a16z\">https://twitter.com/a16z</a></p><p>Find a16z on LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z</a></p><p>Listen to the a16z Podcast on Spotify: <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/5bC65RDvs3oxnLyqqvkUYX\">https://open.spotify.com/show/5bC65RDvs3oxnLyqqvkUYX</a></p><p>Listen to the a16z Podcast on Apple Podcasts: <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a16z-podcast/id842818711\">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a16z-podcast/id842818711</a></p><p>Not an offer or solicitation.
