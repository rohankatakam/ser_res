Tomasz K. Stańczak reveals the EF’s new priorities around developer acceleration, founder support, institutional engagement, and unifying the L2 ecosystem. Ansgar Dietrichs explains why Ethereum is shifting from long-term exploration to near-term execution, detailing the plan to 3x L1 scale annually and accelerate real-time ZKVM progress. Dankrad Feist makes the case for a DeFi-centric L1 where Ethereum becomes the global liquidity layer for RWAs and high-value settlement. And Danny Ryan closes with a raw, personal account of building proof of stake, surviving an SEC scare, and why he still believes Ethereum can meaningfully reshape global finance. These talks matter because they chart the clearest picture yet of where Ethereum is heading, what the next decade requires, and how its core builders are steering it there.<br><br><br>------<br>📣BANKLESS SUMMIT 2025 | SPONSORED BY M0<br><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://bankless.cc/m0\">https://bankless.cc/m0</a><br></p><p class=\"text-node\"></p><p class=\"text-node\">------</p><p class=\"text-node\">BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:</p><p class=\"text-node\"><br></p><p class=\"text-node\">🔵COINBASE | ETH &amp; BTC BACKED LOANS</p><p class=\"text-node\">https://bankless.cc/coinbase-borrow</p><p class=\"text-node\"><br></p><p class=\"text-node\">🪙FRAXNET | MINT, REDEEM, EARN&nbsp;</p><p class=\"text-node\">https://bankless.cc/fraxnet</p><p class=\"text-node\"><br></p><p class=\"text-node\">🦄UNISWAP | SWAP ON UNICHAIN</p><p class=\"text-node\">https://bankless.cc/unichain</p><p class=\"text-node\"><br></p><p class=\"text-node\">🛞MANTLE | MODULAR L2 NETWORK</p><p class=\"text-node\">https://bankless.cc/Mantle</p><p class=\"text-node\"><br></p><p class=\"text-node\">💤EIGHT SLEEP | IMPROVE YOUR SLEEP</p><p class=\"text-node\">https://bankless.cc/eight-sleep</p><p class=\"text-node\"><br></p><p class=\"text-node\">------</p><p class=\"text-node\">TIMESTAMPS &amp; RESOURCES</p><p class=\"text-node\"><br></p><p class=\"text-node\">0:00 Intro</p><p class=\"text-node\">4:19 Tomasz K.

Not as a metaphor or an online community, but as a system that replaces institutions we usually think of as fixed, money, law, and governance.</p><p>In this conversation taken from The Network State Podcast, a16z cofounder Ben Horowitz joins Balaji Srinivasan to explore how internet native institutions are beginning to mirror and challenge traditional state structures. Drawing parallels to China’s early special economic zones, they discuss how constrained experiments like Shenzhen tested new rules without rewriting the entire system, and why similar experimentation is now happening online.</p><p>The discussion examines crypto, digital identity, and network states as attempts to turn code into coordination and coordination into legitimacy, while grappling with a core tension. Code is deterministic, but societies are not. Ben and Balaji explore where these systems work, where they break, and whether network states are a curiosity or the next phase of governance.</p><p> </p><p>Resources:</p><p>Follow Ben on X: https://x.com/bhorowitz</p><p>Follow Balaji on X: https://x.com/balajis</p><p>Listen to more from The Network State: <a href=\"https://ns.com/podcast\">https://ns.com/podcast</a></p><p> </p><p>Stay Updated:</p><p>If you enjoyed this episode, be sure to like, subscribe, and share with your friends!</p><p>Find a16z on X: <a href=\"https://x.com/a16z\">https://x.com/a16z</a></p><p>Find a16z on LinkedIn: </p><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z</a></p><p>Listen to the a16z Podcast on Spotify: <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/5bC65RDvs3oxnLyqqvkUYX\">https://open.spotify.com/show/5bC65RDvs3oxnLyqqvkUYX</a></p><p>Listen to the a16z Podcast on Apple Podcasts: <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a16z-podcast/id842818711\">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a16z-podcast/id842818711</a></p><p>Follow our host: <a href=\"https://x.com/eriktorenberg](https://x.com/eriktorenberg\">https://x.com/eriktorenberg](https://x.com/eriktorenberg</a></p><p>Please note that the content here is for informational purposes only; should NOT be taken as legal, business, tax, or investment advice or be used to evaluate any investment or security; and is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any a16z fund. a16z and its affiliates may maintain investments in the companies discussed.

This week, the crew dives deep into Venezuela's unexpected crypto connections following Maduro's capture, unpacking how the YC-backed fintech Kontigo allegedly used stablecoins to arbitrage sanctions and capital controls.</p> <p>They debate the moral complexities of banking the unbanked versus violating US sanctions, and whether stablecoins are fulfilling their promise of financial freedom or enabling bad actors. The conversation then shifts to prediction markets drama, as a mysterious trader made $400k betting on Maduro's downfall just hours before it happened — sparking calls for insider trading laws in political betting markets.</p> <p>Finally, they tackle the governance chaos in Zcash land, where the entire Electric Coin Company team quit en masse over disagreements with the nonprofit board, launching a new for-profit venture called CashZ. The hosts debate whether this signals the end of the foundation era in crypto, or just growing pains for protocols trying to build killer products.</p> <p><strong>Hosts:</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hosseeb\"><u>Haseeb Qureshi</u></a></li> </ul> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Rleshner\"><u>Robert Leshner</u></a></li> </ul> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/tarunchitra\"><u>Tarun Chitra</u></a></li> </ul> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomhschmidt\"><u>Tom Schmidt</u></a></li> </ul> <p><strong>Links:</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://fintechbusinessweekly.substack.com/p/kontigo-ycombinators-venezuela-sanctions\"><u>FinTech Business Weekly - Kontigo: Y Combinator's Venezuelan Sanctions Evasion Startup</u></a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/americas/maduro-polymarket-bet-a2e5d100\"><u>Wall Street Journal - A Mystery Trader Made $400,000 Betting on Maduro’s Downfall</u></a></li> </ul><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

                    "description": "<p>Join Tommy Shaughnessy as he speaks with Nic Carter, partner at Castle Island Ventures, about his deep dive into the existential threat quantum computing poses to Bitcoin. After six months of intensive research and discussions with Nobel Prize-winning physicists, Nic breaks down why the \"quantum threat\" has moved from theoretical FUD to a material risk that the Bitcoin community is currently unprepared to face.They explore the \"Q-Day\" timeline, the vulnerability of Satoshi’s 2 million BTC, and the urgent need for a migration to post-quantum cryptography. Can Bitcoin’s rigid governance survive the most significant technical challenge in its history, or will sovereign nations and private firms reach the coins first?🎯 Key Highlights▸Why Nic stepped away from podcasts and TV to focus on precise technical writing.▸The 2025 Quantum Inflection: Why 2025 was a record year for quantum investment.▸The Trillion Dollar Bug Bounty: The \"unsolvable\" problem of Satoshi’s P2PK addresses.▸Why Bitcoin developers implemented Taproot without making it quantum-resistant.▸Defense in Depth for BTC: The technical hurdles of implementing post-quantum signature schemes and the potential for a mandatory \"migration\" period.▸How the U.S.–China rivalry mirrors the 1939 race for the atomic bomb.▸Applying maritime law to the potential \"theft\" of ancient Bitcoins by private firms like IBM or Microsoft.▸Scoring the Bitcoin core developers’ preparedness at a 1/100.💡 Want to stay updated with the latest in crypto &amp; AI?

This episode features special guest Vladimir Novakovski, Founder of Lighter, joining the crew to unpack the fallout from October 10’s historic perpetuals liquidation event and the ADL research that sparked a public clash with Hyperliquid. The panel digs into how auto-deleveraging really works, why these failures were long hidden inside centralized exchanges, and what decentralized perps must fix to truly outperform TradFi.</p>\n<p>The conversation then turns to the intensifying perp wars. With Lighter’s zero-fee trading model, premium tiers for pros, and a looming token launch, the hosts debate whether crypto is headed for a Robinhood-style fee reset, why TVL may matter more than volume, and how RWAs, FX perps, and cross-margining are reshaping market structure. Finally, they tackle the growing divide between tokens and equity as devcos get acquired and tokenholders are left behind.</p>\n<p>Perps are evolving, incentives are breaking — let’s get into it.</p>\n<p>Show Highlights</p>\n<p>🔹 ADL research ignites a firestorm — Tarun’s paper on auto-deleveraging sparks a public clash with Hyperliquid and Paradigm, exposing how opaque ADL systems really are.</p>\n<p>🔹 October 10 liquidation shock — Repeated ADLs during crypto’s largest liquidation day reveal structural fragility long hidden inside both CEXs and DEXs.</p>\n<p>🔹 Fairness vs predictability in perps — Why traders care less about perfect algorithms and more about knowing when and how ADLs will hit.</p>\n<p>🔹 Lighter’s design tradeoffs — Vladimir Novakovski explains Lighter’s less-aggressive ADL approach, insurance fund buffers, and trader-friendly risk parameters.</p>\n<p>🔹 Zero-fee perps debate — Lighter’s free retail tier + paid pro tier raises the question: is crypto headed for a Robinhood-style fee reset?</p>\n<p>🔹 TVL beats volume — The panel argues TVL is the most honest signal of trust in perp exchanges, especially during market stress.</p>\n<p>🔹 RWAs and FX perps surprise — Euro and index perps outperform expectations, challenging assumptions about which real-world assets actually trade onchain.</p>\n<p>🔹 Tokens vs equity explode — Devco acquihires (Axelar, Tensor) leave tokenholders behind, reigniting debates over incentive alignment and crypto M&amp;A.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Hosts:</p>\n<p>⭐️<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hosseeb\"><u>Haseeb Qureshi</u></a>, Managing Partner at Dragonfly ⭐️<a href=\"https://twitter.com/tarunchitra\"><u>Tarun Chitra</u></a>, Managing Partner at Robot Ventures<br></p>\n<p>Guest</p>\n<p>⭐️<a href=\"https://x.com/vnovakovski\"><u>Vladimir Novakovski</u></a>, Founder &amp; CEO.

He explains that your mitochondria don’t just “make energy”; they translate what you do—your mindset and your relationships—into the energy you experience as vitality or lack thereof. He explains how exercise, nutrition, sleep, meditation, and even certain thought patterns and our sense of purpose can charge our cells like batteries. He also shares findings that hair greying is the result of cellular stress and is reversible. This episode links physical and mental ‘energy’ with cellular energy and provides science-supported tools to improve your physical and mental health.</p>\n<p>Read the episode show notes at <a href=\"https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/improve-energy-longevity-by-optimizing-mitochondria-martin-picard\">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Thank you to our sponsors</strong></p>\n<p>AG1: <a href=\"https://drinkag1.com/huberman\">https://drinkag1.com/huberman</a></p>\n<p>Helix: <a href=\"https://helixsleep.com/huberman\">https://helixsleep.com/huberman</a></p>\n<p>Lingo: <a href=\"https://hellolingo.com/huberman\">https://hellolingo.com/huberman</a></p>\n<p>Function: <a href=\"https://functionhealth.com/huberman\">https://functionhealth.com/huberman</a></p>\n<p>Waking Up: <a href=\"https://wakingup.com/huberman\">https://wakingup.com/huberman</a></p>\n<p><strong>Timestamps</strong></p>\n<p>(00:00:00) Martin Picard</p>\n<p>(00:03:50) What is Energy?, Energy Flow &amp; Transformation</p>\n<p>(00:07:53) Energy, Vitality, Emotions, Sensory Perception</p>\n<p>(00:14:18) Sponsors: Helix Sleep &amp; Lingo</p>\n<p>(00:17:19) “Mito-Centric” View of World, Mitochondrial Energy &amp; Information Patterns</p>\n<p>(00:25:26) Organelles, Mitochondria &amp; Energy Transformation; Maternal Genes</p>\n<p>(00:31:12) Mitotypes &amp; Differentiation, Mitochondria as “Social Organisms”</p>\n<p>(00:36:52) Food &amp; Dysfunctional Energy Transformation </p>\n<p>(00:40:02) Lifestyle Choices &amp; Interests, Physiological Growth</p>\n<p>(00:46:39) Pregnancy, Amenorrhea; Illness &amp; Tiredness</p>\n<p>(00:51:07) Sponsor: AG1</p>\n<p>(00:52:29) Energy Transformation &amp; Distribution; Body’s Wisdom, Feeling Sick</p>\n<p>(00:56:27) Tool: Feel Your Energy; Breath &amp; Energy </p>\n<p>(01:02:31) Flow of Energy; Trade-Offs, Life Purpose &amp; Enjoyment</p>\n<p>(01:10:15) Biology, Meaningful Experiences &amp; Energy Flow</p>\n<p>(01:16:27) Sponsor: Function</p>\n<p>(00:18:15) Inflammation, Energetic Flow</p>\n<p>(01:20:43) Child Prodigies, Species Lifespan &amp; Mitochondrial Metabolism; Aging</p>\n<p>(01:28:56) Lifestyle &amp; Aging: Exercise, Fasting; Inflammation, Sleep, Stimulants</p>\n<p>(01:37:06) Energetic Stress Signals, GDF-15, Cancer, Heart Failure</p>\n<p>(01:42:18) Genes, Lifestyle &amp; Aging</p>\n<p>(01:47:54) Gray Hair Reversal, Stress; Inflammation &amp; Aging</p>\n<p>(01:57:37) Energy Recovery, Sleep &amp; Mitochondrial Function, Stress, Meditation</p>\n<p>(02:05:16) Tools: Yoga Nidra, NSDR; Pre-Sleep Relaxation, Energy &amp; Restorative Sleep</p>\n<p>(02:10:58) Diet &amp; Individualization, Clinical Trials; Mitochondria &amp; Nutrition, Keto</p>\n<p>(02:20:14) Alcohol &amp; Energy Budget; Stress</p>\n<p>(02:25:02) Exercise, Increase Mitochondria, Overtraining; Resistance &amp; Growth</p>\n<p>(02:33:06) Sponsor: Waking Up</p>\n<p>(02:34:41) Supplements &amp; Mitochondria Health, Deficiencies, SS31, Methylene Blue</p>\n<p>(02:41:31) Energy Flow &amp; Experiences, Balance</p>\n<p>(02:49:13) Transform Through Resistance, Energetic Awareness, Connection</p>\n<p>(02:56:05) Food Overconsumption &amp; Mitochondria Disruption; Tissues &amp; Mitochondria</p>\n<p>(03:01:02) Mitochondrial Health Test; Tool: Ways to Increase Energy; Meditation</p>\n<p>(03:06:10) Peptides; Fertility Supplements, Urolithin A; Electromagnetic Fields</p>\n<p>(03:12:16) Acknowledgements</p>\n<p>(03:14:15) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify &amp; Apple Follow, Reviews &amp; Feedback, Sponsors, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

He explains that long-wavelength light (red, near-infrared and infrared) can enter the body and brain to enhance mitochondrial function and thereby improve metabolism, eyesight, blood glucose regulation, mood, hormones and more. We also discuss how short-wavelength light from LED bulbs can impair mitochondrial health and why balanced, full-spectrum light is essential for health.

He became widely known for studying a tablet with a Mesopotamian flood story that predates the biblical Noah narrative, which he presented in his book &#8220;The Ark Before Noah&#8221; and in a documentary that involved building a circular ark based on the tablet&#8217;s technical instructions.<br />\nThank you for listening ❤ Check out our sponsors: <a href=\"https://lexfridman.com/sponsors/ep487-sc\">https://lexfridman.com/sponsors/ep487-sc</a><br />\nSee below for timestamps, transcript, and to give feedback, submit questions, contact Lex, etc.</p>\n<p><b>Transcript:</b><br />\n<a href=\"https://lexfridman.com/irving-finkel-transcript\">https://lexfridman.com/irving-finkel-transcript</a></p>\n<p><b>CONTACT LEX:</b><br />\n<b>Feedback</b> &#8211; give feedback to Lex: <a href=\"https://lexfridman.com/survey\">https://lexfridman.com/survey</a><br />\n<b>AMA</b> &#8211; submit questions, videos or call-in: <a href=\"https://lexfridman.com/ama\">https://lexfridman.com/ama</a><br />\n<b>Hiring</b> &#8211; join our team: <a href=\"https://lexfridman.com/hiring\">https://lexfridman.com/hiring</a><br />\n<b>Other</b> &#8211; other ways to get in touch: <a href=\"https://lexfridman.com/contact\">https://lexfridman.com/contact</a></p>\n<p><b>EPISODE LINKS:</b><br />\nIrving&#8217;s Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/drirvingfinkel/\">https://www.instagram.com/drirvingfinkel/</a><br />\nThe Ark Before Noah (book): <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4j2U0DW\">https://amzn.to/4j2U0DW</a><br />\nIrving Lectures Playlist: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYXwZvOwHjVcFUi9iEqirkXRaCUJdXGha\">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYXwZvOwHjVcFUi9iEqirkXRaCUJdXGha</a><br />\nBritish Museum Video Playlist: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0LQM0SAx603A6p5EJ9DVcESqQReT7QyK\">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0LQM0SAx603A6p5EJ9DVcESqQReT7QyK</a><br />\nBritish Museum Website: <a href=\"https://www.britishmuseum.org/\">https://www.britishmuseum.org/</a><br />\nThe Great Diary Project: <a href=\"https://thegreatdiaryproject.co.uk/\">https://thegreatdiaryproject.co.uk/</a></p>\n<p><b>SPONSORS:</b><br />\nTo support this podcast, check out our sponsors &amp; get discounts:<br />\n<b>Shopify:</b> Sell stuff online.<br />\nGo to <a href=\"https://lexfridman.com/s/shopify-ep487-sc\">https://shopify.com/lex</a><br />\n<b>Miro:</b> Online collaborative whiteboard platform.<br />\nGo to <a href=\"https://lexfridman.com/s/miro-ep487-sc\">https://miro.com/</a><br />\n<b>Chevron:</b> Reliable energy for data centers.<br />\nGo to <a href=\"https://lexfridman.com/s/chevron-ep487-sc\">https://chevron.com/power</a><br />\n<b>LMNT:</b> Zero-sugar electrolyte drink mix.<br />\nGo to <a href=\"https://lexfridman.com/s/lmnt-ep487-sc\">https://drinkLMNT.com/lex</a><br />\n<b>AG1:</b> All-in-one daily nutrition drink.<br />\nGo to <a href=\"https://lexfridman.com/s/ag1-ep487-sc\">https://drinkag1.com/lex</a></p>\n<p><b>OUTLINE:</b><br />\n(00:00) &#8211; Introduction<br />\n(00:43) &#8211; Sponsors, Comments, and Reflections<br />\n(09:53) &#8211; Origins of human language<br />\n(15:59) &#8211; Cuneiform<br />\n(23:12) &#8211; Controversial theory about Göbekli Tepe<br />\n(34:23) &#8211; How to write and speak Cuneiform<br />\n(39:42) &#8211; Primitive human language<br />\n(41:26) &#8211; Development of writing systems<br />\n(42:20) &#8211; Decipherment of Cuneiform<br />\n(54:51) &#8211; Limits of language<br />\n(59:51) &#8211; Art of translation<br />\n(1:05:01) &#8211; Gods<br />\n(1:10:25) &#8211; Ghosts<br />\n(1:20:13) &#8211; Ancient flood stories<br />\n(1:30:21) &#8211; Noah&#8217;s Ark<br />\n(1:41:44) &#8211; The Royal Game of Ur<br />\n(1:54:43) &#8211; British Museum<br />\n(2:02:08) &#8211; Evolution of human civilization</p>",

Her central insight is that babies learn like scientists, running experiments and updating beliefs based on evidence. But Tyler wonders: are scientists actually good learners? It's a question that leads them into a wide-ranging conversation about what we've been systematically underestimating in young minds, what's wrong with simple nature-versus-nurture frameworks, and whether AI represents genuine intelligence or just a very sophisticated library.</p> <p class=\"font-claude-response-body\">Tyler and Alison cover how children systematically experiment on the world and what study she'd run with $100 million, why babies are more conscious than adults and what consciousness even means, episodic memory and aphantasia, whether Freud got anything right about childhood and what's held up best from Piaget, how we should teach young children versus school-age kids, how AI should change K-12 education and Gopnik's case that it's a cultural technology rather than intelligence, whether the enterprise of twin studies makes sense and why she sees nature versus nurture as the wrong framework entirely, autism and ADHD as diagnostic categories, whether the success of her siblings belies her skepticism about genetic inheritance, her new project on the economics and philosophy of caregiving, and more.</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><em>Read a <a href= \"https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/alison-gopnik/\">full transcript</a> enhanced with helpful links, or watch the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIFdeXPB1Pg\">full video</a> on the new dedicated Conversations with Tyler channel.</em></p> <p class=\"p1\"><em>Recorded October 30th, 2025</em><em>.</em></p> <p class=\"p1\"> Other ways to connect</p> <ul> <li class=\"p1\" style= \"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Follow us on <a href= \"https://twitter.com/cowenconvos\">X</a> and <a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/cowenconvos/?hl=en\">Instagram</a></li> <li class=\"p1\" style= \"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tylercowen\">Tyler</a> on X</li> <li class=\"p1\" style= \"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Follow <a href=\"https://x.com/AlisonGopnik\">Alison</a> on X</li> <li style= \"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> <a class=\"c-link\" href=\"https://mercatus.tfaforms.net/5060931\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\" data-stringify-link=\"https://www.tfaforms.com/5060931\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">Sign up for our newsletter</a></li> <li style= \"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Join our <a href= \"https://discord.gg/JAVWP7vTxt\">Discord</a></li> <li class=\"p1\" style= \"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Email us: <a class=\"c-link\" tabindex=\"-1\" href= \"mailto:cowenconvos@mercatus.gmu.edu\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"mailto:cowenconvos@mercatus.gmu.edu\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\" aria-haspopup=\"menu\" aria-expanded=\"false\" data-remove-tab-index= \"true\">cowenconvos@mercatus.gmu.edu</a></li> <li class=\"p1\" style= \"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Learn more about Conversations with Tyler and other Mercatus Center podcasts <a href= \"https://www.mercatus.org/podcasts\">here</a>.</li> </ul> <p>Timestamps</p> <p>00:00:00 - How children—and scientists—learn</p> <p>00:14:35 - Consciousness, episodic memories, and aphantasia</p> <p>00:23:06 - Freud's and Piaget's theories about childhood</p> <p>00:27:49 - Twin studies and nature vs. nurture</p> <p>00:39:33 - Teaching strategies for younger vs. older children</p> <p>00:44:07 - AI's ability to generate novel insights</p> <p>00:53:57 - What Autism and ADHD diagnoses do and don't reveal</p> <p>00:58:02 - The success of the Gopnik siblings</p> <p>Photo Credit: Rod Searcey</p>",

We also discuss time perception and why it speeds up or slows down depending on our age and stress level. We cover dreaming and the meaning of visual and other dream content. And we discuss the neuroscience of cultural and political polarization and how to remedy it. This episode provides science-based knowledge and practical tools you can use to enhance learning and better understand your experience of life in the past, present and future.</p>\n<p>Read the episode show notes at <a href=\"https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/science-and-tools-of-learning-and-memory-david-eagleman\">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Thank you to our sponsors</strong></p>\n<p>AG1: <a href=\"https://drinkag1.com/huberman\">https://drinkag1.com/huberman</a></p>\n<p>Mateina: <a href=\"https://drinkmateina.com/offer\">https://drinkmateina.com/offer</a></p>\n<p>Rorra: <a href=\"https://rorra.com/huberman\">https://rorra.com/huberman</a></p>\n<p>Lingo: <a href=\"https://hellolingo.com/huberman\">https://hellolingo.com/huberman</a></p>\n<p>Function: <a href=\"https://functionhealth.com/huberman\">https://functionhealth.com/huberman</a></p>\n<p><strong>Timestamps</strong></p>\n<p>(00:00:00) David Eagleman</p>\n<p>(00:02:35) Neuroplasticity &amp; Learning; Cortex, Flexibility &amp; Repurposing, Savantism</p>\n<p>(00:11:07) Sponsors: Mateina &amp; Rorra</p>\n<p>(00:13:27) Specialization vs Diversification, Practice; Internet &amp; Curiosity</p>\n<p>(00:22:05) Building a Well-Rounded Brain, Tool: Critical Thinking &amp; Creativity</p>\n<p>(00:28:18) Neuroplasticity &amp; Adults, Tools: Novelty &amp; Challenge</p>\n<p>(00:32:41) Neuromodulators &amp; Plasticity, Psychedelics; Directed Plasticity</p>\n<p>(00:38:50) Sponsor: AG1</p>\n<p>(00:39:41) Building a Better Future Self, Tool: Ulysses Contract to Avoid Bad Behaviors</p>\n<p>(00:50:13) Brain Chatter, Aphantasia &amp; Practice</p>\n<p>(00:56:57) Specialization vs Diverse Experience, Childhood &amp; Brain</p>\n<p>(01:00:50) Space &amp; Time Perception, Tool: Space-Time Bridging Meditation</p>\n<p>(01:06:17) Are We Good at Estimating Time?; Fear, Time &amp; Memory</p>\n<p>(01:11:23) Sponsor: Lingo</p>\n<p>(01:12:53) Fearful Situations &amp; Time Perception; Joyful Events &amp; Novelty, Tool: Do Things Differently</p>\n<p>(01:18:56) Staying in the Present, Mental Illness &amp; Time Domains, Addiction</p>\n<p>(01:27:09) Social Media, Addiction, Curiosity</p>\n<p>(01:30:51) Vision &amp; Auditory Deficits, Sensory Substitution, Neosensory Wristband</p>\n<p>(01:35:26) Sponsor: Function</p>\n<p>(01:37:13) Sensory Reliance, Echolocation, Potato Head Theory, Sensory Addition</p>\n<p>(01:41:36) Why We Dream, Vision &amp; Neuroplasticity, REM Sleep, Blindness</p>\n<p>(01:49:55) Victims, Fear, Memory Drift &amp; Recall, Eyewitness Testimony &amp; Jury Education</p>\n<p>(01:56:10) Kids vs Adults, Memory Manipulation; Photos</p>\n<p>(01:59:27) Polarization, In vs Out Groups, Empathy; Fairness</p>\n<p>(02:06:31) Polarization, Reward vs Punishment; Propaganda, Language, Complexification</p>\n<p>(02:19:27) Current Projects; Acknowledgements</p>\n<p>(02:21:44) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify &amp; Apple Follow, Reviews &amp; Feedback, Sponsors, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer\">Disclaimer &amp; Disclosures</a></p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

                    "description": "<p>My guest this week is <a href=\"https://x.com/GavinSBaker\">Gavin Bake</a>r. Gavin is the managing partner and CIO of Atreides Management, and he has been on the show many times before. </p>\n<p>I will never forget when I first met Gavin in 2017. I find his interest in markets, his curiosity about the world to be as infectious as any investor that I've ever come across. He's encyclopedic on what is going on in the world of technology today, and I've had the good fortune to host him every year or two on this podcast.</p>\n<p>Gavin began covering Nvidia as an investor more than two decades ago, giving him a rare perspective on how the company – and the entire semiconductor ecosystem – has evolved. A lot has changed since our <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/05Fx7yNSEA148kHr1znbrb\"><u>last conversation</u></a> a year ago, making this the perfect time to revisit the topic.</p>\n<p>In this conversation, we talk about everything that interests Gavin – Nvidia’s GPUs, Google’s TPUs, the changing AI landscape, the math and business models around AI companies and everything in between. We also discussed the idea of data centers in space, which he communicates with his usual passion and logic.</p>\n<p>In closing, at the end of this conversation, because I've asked him my traditional closing question before, I asked him a different question, which led to a discussion of his entire investing origin story that I had never heard before.</p>\n<p>Because Gavin is one of the most passionate thinkers and investors that I know, these conversations are always amongst my most favorite. I hope you enjoy this latest in the series of discussions with Gavin Baker.</p>\n<p>For the full show notes, transcript, and links to mentioned content, check out the episode page <a href=\"https://joincolossus.com/episode/nvidia-v-google-%E2%80%A6-economics-of-ai/\"><u>⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠here⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠</u></a><u>.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠</u></p>\n<p><strong>-----</strong></p>\n<p><strong>This episode is brought to you by</strong>⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠<strong> </strong><a href=\"http://ramp.com/invest\"><strong>Ramp</strong><u>⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠</u></a><strong>.

Henry built his reputation at T. Rowe Price, where he led the New Horizons Fund and turned it into one of the best-performing small-cap growth portfolios in the country. In 2019, he left to start Durable.</p>\n<p>His philosophy is grounded in a simple belief that great investing is about understanding people and change. Henry has spent his career studying the rare 1% of companies that drive nearly all long-term returns . Durable’s edge comes from being able to tell the difference between a company that is failing and one that is transforming.</p>\n<p>Henry often talks about “Act II” teams – founders who take the lessons from their first company and apply them to a new frontier. Durable itself is his Act II.</p>\n<p>In our latest Colossus <a href=\"https://joincolossus.com/article/henry-ellenbogen-last-human-edge/\">profile</a>, Managing Editor <a href=\"https://x.com/domcooke\">Dom Cooke</a> traces Henry’s story and specifically how he became one of the most influential investors of the 21st century, having learned from founders like Jeff Bezos and John Malone in the early part of his career. I always hear the same thing from founders who’ve met Henry: “he understood my business faster than anyone”. The thing that sticks with me from our conversation and Dom’s profile is just how much he loves investing. </p>\n<p>For the full show notes, transcript, and links to mentioned content, check out the episode page <a href=\"https://joincolossus.com/episode/man-versus-machine\"><u>⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠here⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠</u></a><u>.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠</u></p>\n<p><strong>-----</strong></p>\n<p><strong>This episode is brought to you by</strong>⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠<strong> </strong><a href=\"http://ramp.com/invest\"><strong>Ramp</strong><u>⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠</u></a><strong>.

It’s about whether the systems around it can move fast enough to support the next wave of industrial demand.</p>\n<p>To kick things off, we dig into some of the forces redefining the power sector: the fight over capacity, the rise of co-located and merchant power, the limits of data center flexibility, and what Alphabet’s acquisition of Intersect Power tells us about the race to buy power.</p>\n<p>We also officially introduce Caroline Golin as our new regular co-host. Caroline brings a unique perspective to <em>Open Circuit</em>: she spent the last seven years inside Google, where she served as global head of energy market development and innovation. </p>\n<p>Caroline helped shape how Google procures electricity, engages utilities, and navigates capacity constraints across global markets. That experience puts her at the center of many of today’s most urgent questions around energy.</p>\n<p>Welcome to the new <em>Open Circuit</em>, where we decode how clean energy actually gets built. If you want to watch the episode, subscribe to the show on YouTube!</p>\n<p><em>With resilience now a leading driver of grid investments, Latitude Media and The Ad Hoc Group are hosting the </em><a href=\"https://www.resilience-forum.com/\"><em>Power Resilience Forum</em></a><em> in Houston, Texas on January 21-23, 2026.

Lastly, we discuss Long Game, an innovative company seeking to improve personal savings in the U.S. Ashby is a passion-driven, creative thinker who rightfully has the ear of some of the most important pools of capital in the world.

At its peak, about 25 percent of all venture dollars were pouring into the category. By late 2022, that number had collapsed to almost zero. In this conversation, a16z General Partner David Haber and Plaid cofounder and CEO Zach Perret unpack what actually happened during that cycle and why the market is heating up again.</p><p>We explore how the industry moved from the explosive growth of 2020 and 2021 into a deep freeze, and why we are now seeing real momentum return. We also dig into the forces reshaping fintech today: AI’s outsized impact on fraud and underwriting, incumbents finally embracing external software, the renewed importance of deposits, and the rise of embedded finance across entirely new categories.</p><p>Zach shares how Plaid has navigated these shifts, what the company is building now, and how he sees the next phase of fintech taking shape.</p><p> </p><p>Resources:</p><p>Find Zach on X: <a href=\"https://x.com/zachperret\">https://x.com/zachperret</a></p><p>Find David on X: <a href=\"https://x.com/dhaber\">https://x.com/dhaber</a></p><p> </p><p>Stay Updated:</p><p>If you enjoyed this episode, be sure to like, subscribe, and share with your friends!</p><p>Find a16z on X: https://twitter.com/a16z</p><p>Find a16z on LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z</a></p><p>Listen to the a16z Podcast on Spotify: <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/5bC65RDvs3oxnLyqqvkUYX\">https://open.spotify.com/show/5bC65RDvs3oxnLyqqvkUYX</a></p><p>Listen to the a16z Podcast on Apple Podcasts: <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a16z-podcast/id842818711\">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a16z-podcast/id842818711</a></p><p>Please note that the content here is for informational purposes only; should NOT be taken as legal, business, tax, or investment advice or be used to evaluate any investment or security; and is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any a16z fund. a16z and its affiliates may maintain investments in the companies discussed.

He argues markets may want out of the dollar, but the Eurodollar system keeps pulling demand back in, and “dollar down” headlines do not break the framework. Brent also covers how debt stress can spill into political instability, why stablecoins and the GENIUS Act could accelerate re-dollarization, and what this means for monetary sovereignty. We close with China’s counter-strategy and how Brent thinks about positioning from here.<br></p><p class=\"text-node\">---</p><p class=\"text-node\">📣SPOTIFY PREMIUM RSS FEED | USE CODE: SPOTIFY24<br><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://bankless.cc/spotify-premium\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://bankless.cc/spotify-premium</a></p><p class=\"text-node\"></p><p class=\"text-node\">---<br>👑BANKLESS PREMIUM | AD-FREE &amp; BONUS EPISODES<br><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://bankless.cc/spotify-premium\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://bankless.cc/spotify-premium</a><br></p><p class=\"text-node\">🎯THE DEFI REPORT | ONCHAIN INSIGHTS<br><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://bankless.cc/the-defi-report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://bankless.cc/the-defi-report</a><br></p><p class=\"text-node\">💰ICO WATCH | UPCOMING PUBLIC TOKEN SALES<br><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://bankless.cc/ico-watch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://bankless.cc/ico-watch</a><br></p><p class=\"text-node\">---<br>TIMESTAMPS<br></p><p class=\"text-node\">0:00 Intro<br>1:20 De-Dollarizing vs Re-Dollarizing: Milkshake Recap<br>4:18 What a Sovereign Debt Crisis Actually Means<br>5:45 Central Banks as “Professional Can-Kickers”<br>8:56 Can They Slowly Let the Air Out?<br>11:03 Can AI Productivity Save the System?<br>13:06 2025 Setup: The Narrative for Dedollarization<br>18:06 BRICS: Conference Talk vs Structural Reality<br>23:37 Store of Value vs Medium of Exchange<br>34:24 “Crisis = Dollar Up” (and the April Exception)<br>39:06 Stablecoin Redollarization and the GENIUS Act<br>47:20 Monetary Sovereignty, Faster Bank Runs, Faster Dollarization<br>52:34 China’s Response: Two Currency Stacks<br>54:21 Positioning as an Investor<br><br>---<br>RESOURCES<br></p><p class=\"text-node\">Brent Johnson<br><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://x.com/SantiagoAuFund\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://x.com/SantiagoAuFund</a><br></p><p class=\"text-node\">The Dollar Milkshake Theory<br><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://research.santiagocapital.com/p/the-dollar-milkshake\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://research.santiagocapital.com/p/the-dollar-milkshake</a><br></p><p class=\"text-node\">---<br>Not financial or tax advice.

Nick previously spent two decades leading JP Morgan's emerging markets business across multiple cycles and served on the bank's Executive Committee. He also served as the founding chair of the Emerging Market Traders Association and later as chair of the Emerging Markets Private Equity Association.</p> <p> Nick's worldview is also shaped by his international family history of doing well while doing good. His grandfather, Clarence Streit, was a longtime New York Times foreign correspondent, and his father, Felix Rohatyn, was one of the most influential financiers of his generation.</p> <p> Our conversation traces Nick's path from his international upbringing to capital markets innovation at JP Morgan and the founding of TRG. We discuss his multi-asset class, horizontal investment approach to emerging markets, problems of emerging market benchmarks, necessity of diversification in surviving volatile cycles, importance of currency management, and value of creating scale through acquisitions. We close with Nick's views on the opportunity ahead and his ambition to build a leading global, multi-asset class emerging markets firm.</p> <p> Learn More Follow Ted on Twitter at <a href= \"https://twitter.com/tseides?lang=en\">@tseides</a> or <a href= \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tedseides/\">LinkedIn</a> Subscribe to the <a href=\"https://capitalallocators.com/\">mailing list</a> Access Transcript with <a href= \"https://capitalallocators.com/signup\">Premium Membership</a></p> <p> </p> <em>Editing and post-production work for this episode was provided by The Podcast Consultant (</em><a title= \"https://thepodcastconsultant.com/\" href= \"https://thepodcastconsultant.com/\">⁠</a><a title= \"https://thepodcastconsultant.com/\" href= \"https://thepodcastconsultant.com/\">https://thepodcastconsultant.com</a><a title=\"https://thepodcastconsultant.com/\" href=\"https://thepodcastconsultant.com/\">⁠</a><em>)</em>",

We dive into his thoughts on the implications of the growth of private credit for investors.</p> <p> With that, I hope you sprint to the finish line of this year with all the gusto in your soul, and come out on the other side of the ball drop with renewed excitement, aspirations, and energy for the year ahead.</p> <p> Learn More Follow Ted on Twitter at <a href= \"https://twitter.com/tseides?lang=en\">@tseides</a> or <a href= \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tedseides/\">LinkedIn</a> Subscribe to the <a href=\"https://capitalallocators.com/\">mailing list</a> Access Transcript with <a href= \"https://capitalallocators.com/signup\">Premium Membership</a></p> <p> </p> <em>Editing and post-production work for this episode was provided by The Podcast Consultant (</em><a title= \"https://thepodcastconsultant.com/\" href= \"https://thepodcastconsultant.com/\">⁠</a><a title= \"https://thepodcastconsultant.com/\" href= \"https://thepodcastconsultant.com/\">https://thepodcastconsultant.com</a><a title=\"https://thepodcastconsultant.com/\" href=\"https://thepodcastconsultant.com/\">⁠</a><em>)</em>",

After 15 years in the business, Long Pond is one of the few remaining firms in the niche. Long Pond recently launched an active ETF, ticker: LPRE, which invests in the most attractively priced stocks from Long Pond's list of the highest-quality real estate businesses. </p> <p class=\"m_-476419393443406134paragraph\">Our conversation covers John's path into public real estate investing, changes in the investable universe, and the impact of passive flows and pod shops on the sector. We turn to Long Pond's investment process, focused on identifying and exploiting asymmetry, and cover John's perspectives on the major real estate sub-sectors. We close with a discussion of Long Pond's new actively managed ETF. </p> <p class=\"m_-476419393443406134paragraph\">Learn More Follow Ted on Twitter at <a title=\"https://twitter.com/tseides?lang=en\" href=\"https://twitter.com/tseides?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl= \"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/tseides?lang%3Den&source=gmail&ust=1764441620665000&usg=AOvVaw0fmEZvVzJxvtevcOk2oU9z\">@tseides</a> or <a title=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tedseides/\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tedseides/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl= \"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/tedseides/&source=gmail&ust=1764441620665000&usg=AOvVaw3uyY_2LfuEKhy5q_D8a3QA\">LinkedIn</a> Subscribe to the <a title=\"https://capitalallocators.com/\" href=\"https://capitalallocators.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl= \"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://capitalallocators.com/&source=gmail&ust=1764441620665000&usg=AOvVaw2oLOafq__9DaLIaS68Nssg\">mailing list</a> Access Transcript with <a title=\"https://capitalallocators.com/signup\" href=\"https://capitalallocators.com/signup\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl= \"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://capitalallocators.com/signup&source=gmail&ust=1764441620665000&usg=AOvVaw0YuShevGigt5JZkJ5Utgd7\">Premium Membership</a></p> <p class=\"m_-476419393443406134paragraph\"> </p> <em>Editing and post-production work for this episode was provided by The Podcast Consultant (</em><a title= \"https://thepodcastconsultant.com/\" href= \"https://thepodcastconsultant.com/\">⁠</a><a title= \"https://thepodcastconsultant.com/\" href= \"https://thepodcastconsultant.com/\">https://thepodcastconsultant.com</a><a title=\"https://thepodcastconsultant.com/\" href=\"https://thepodcastconsultant.com/\">⁠</a><em>)</em>",

When people or companies use AI to break the law, existing criminal, civil rights, consumer protection, and antitrust frameworks should still apply. Enforcement agencies should have the resources they need to enforce the law. If existing bodies of law fall short in accounting for certain AI use cases, any new laws should be evidence-based, clearly defining marginal risks and the optimal approach to target harms directly. </p><p>In this conversation, we go deeper on what that principle means in practice with Martin Casado, general partner at a16z where he leads the firm’s infrastructure practice and invests in advanced AI systems and foundational compute. Martin has lived through multiple platform shifts–as a researcher where he worked on large-scale simulations for the Department of Defense before working with the intelligence community on networking and cybersecurity, a pioneer of software-defined networking at Stanford, and the cofounder and CTO of Nicira, which was acquired by VMware–giving him a rare perspective on how breakthrough technologies are governed as they develop and scale. </p><p>Martin joins Jai Ramaswamy and Matt Perault to discuss how decades of technology policy can inform addressing harmful uses of AI, defining marginal risk in AI, the importance of open source for long-term competitiveness, and more. </p><p> </p><p>Follow Jai Ramaswamy on X:<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jai_ramaswamy\"> https://twitter.com/jai_ramaswamy</a></p><p>Follow Matt Perault on X:<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MattPerault\"> https://twitter.com/MattPerault</a></p><p>Follow Martin Casado on X:<a href=\"https://x.com/martin_casado\"> https://twitter.com/martin_casado</a></p><p>Read the a16z AI Policy Brief here: <a href=\"https://a16zpolicy.substack.com/\">https://a16zpolicy.substack.com/</a></p>\n<p><p>Check out everything a16z is doing with artificial intelligence <a href=\"https://a16z.com/ai/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, including articles, projects, and more podcasts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Please note that the content here is for informational purposes only; should NOT be taken as legal, business, tax, or investment advice or be used to evaluate any investment or security; and is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any a16z fund. a16z and its affiliates may maintain investments in the companies discussed.

His prescription: America should become 20% more engineering-minded to fix its broken infrastructure, while China needs to be 50% more lawyerly so the Communist Party can stop strangling individual rights and the creative impulses of its people. But would a more lawyerly China constrain state power, or just create new tools for oppression? And aren't the American suburbs actually sterling achievements where the infrastructure works quite well?</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\">Tyler and Dan debate whether American infrastructure is actually broken or just differently optimized, why health care spending should reach 35% of GDP, how lawyerly influences shaped East Asian development differently than China, China's lack of a liberal tradition and why it won't democratize like South Korea or Taiwan did, its economic dysfunction despite its manufacturing superstars, Chinese pragmatism and bureaucratic incentives, a 10-day itinerary for Yunnan, James C. Scott's work on Zomia, whether Beijing or Shanghai is the better city, Liu Cixin and why volume one of <em>The Three-Body Problem</em> is the best, why contemporary Chinese music and film have declined under Xi, Chinese marriage markets and what it's like to be elderly in China, the Dan Wang production function, why Stendhal is his favorite novelist and Rossini's <em>Comte Ory</em> moves him, what Dan wants to learn next, whether LLMs will make Tyler's hyper-specific podcast questions obsolete, what flavor of drama their conversation turned out to be, and more.</p> <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><em>Read a <a href= \"https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/dan-wang/\">full transcript</a> enhanced with helpful links, or watch the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/qCGG3s4Luyw\">full video</a> on the new dedicated Conversations with Tyler channel.</em></p> <p class=\"p1\"><em>Recorded October 31st, 2025</em><em>.</em></p> <p class=\"p1\"> Other ways to connect</p> <ul> <li class=\"p1\" style= \"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Follow us on <a href= \"https://twitter.com/cowenconvos\">X</a> and <a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/cowenconvos/?hl=en\">Instagram</a></li> <li class=\"p1\" style= \"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tylercowen\">Tyler</a> on X</li> <li class=\"p1\" style= \"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Follow <a href=\"https://x.com/danwwang\">Dan</a> on X</li> <li style= \"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> <a class=\"c-link\" href=\"https://mercatus.tfaforms.net/5060931\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\" data-stringify-link=\"https://www.tfaforms.com/5060931\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">Sign up for our newsletter</a></li> <li style= \"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Join our <a href= \"https://discord.gg/JAVWP7vTxt\">Discord</a></li> <li class=\"p1\" style= \"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Email us: <a class=\"c-link\" tabindex=\"-1\" href= \"mailto:cowenconvos@mercatus.gmu.edu\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"mailto:cowenconvos@mercatus.gmu.edu\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\" aria-haspopup=\"menu\" aria-expanded=\"false\" data-remove-tab-index= \"true\">cowenconvos@mercatus.gmu.edu</a></li> <li class=\"p1\" style= \"font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> Learn more about Conversations with Tyler and other Mercatus Center podcasts <a href= \"https://www.mercatus.org/podcasts\">here</a>.</li> </ul> <p>Timestamps 00:00:00 - American infrastructure and suburban life 00:05:18 - American vs. Chinese infrastructure buildouts... 00:12:25 - And health care investment 00:17:52 - Chinese suburbs 00:20:10 - The existing lawyerly influence in East Asia 00:25:12 - China's lack of a liberal tradition 00:29:35 - Why China's won't democratize 00:33:49 - China's economic disfunction 00:38:44 - China's expansionism 00:41:55 - Chinese pragmatism and bureaucratic incentives 00:46:50 - Chinese cities and regional culture 00:59:44 - James C.

Whether you call their orchestration virtual power plants, distributed power plants, or think both those descriptions suck, the reality is that there’s a convergence of technology and need for energy assets that can be deployed quickly.</p><p>No longer a cute side show (duh), DERs are being deployed at scale. This discussion brings together folks with the battle scars of early days of DER deployment who are leading the charge now that affordability and capacity constraints are the calling card of the day.

It’s a sprawling set of contracts for both existing plants and next-generation reactors that totals 6.6 gigawatts.</p>\n<p>Just a few years ago, the conversation in the U.S. was about which nuclear plants were going to shut down next. Now, some of the world’s largest technology companies are trying to lock them up under long-term contracts, while building new ones.</p>\n<p>But critics argue that parts of Meta’s deal don’t add new capacity fast enough — possibly pushing electricity prices even higher in an already-tight market.</p>\n<p>And that concern is suddenly political. This week, President Trump said tech companies need to pay their own way when it comes to electricity, signaling just how central data centers are to the national debate over affordability.</p>\n<p>This week, we have a breakdown of Meta’s nuclear push. We’ll look at what it means for power markets, how it compares to what the rest of the hyperscalers are doing, and whether this moment actually changes the future of advanced nuclear.</p>\n<p><em>Credits: Co-hosted by Stephen Lacey, Jigar Shah, and Caroline Golin.

                    "description": "<p>This week on Unsupervised Learning, Jacob Effron is joined by Jordan Schneider, host of China Talk, who challenges widespread assumptions about US-China AI competition. China's AI development is driven by private capital and market competition—not central government planning—with companies like DeepSeek, Alibaba, and ByteDance operating more like Silicon Valley startups than state projects. The critical bottleneck is compute: the West maintains a 10-15x advantage in advanced chips, and US export controls implemented one month before ChatGPT created a structural edge favoring America for years. Chinese companies aggressively open-source models from strategic necessity—they couldn't establish a quality gap justifying paid access like OpenAI. Jordan explains why the \"Goldilocks strategy\" of controlled chip dependency fails, why expert consensus opposes selling advanced semiconductors to China despite Nvidia's lobbying, and how Taiwan's invasion risk is driven more by domestic politics than AGI scenarios. China's real advantage may emerge in robotics manufacturing at scale, where they're already deploying while the US debates strategy.</p><p> </p><p>Inside the Politburo's AI Study Session: https://www.chinatalk.media/p/xi-takes-an-ai-masterclass</p><p>Question Form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1vHBYv0bTT_EgFWTjbKnLr_sn3pZnFmcFGWYVTltKEco/edit</p><p> </p><p>(0:00) Intro</p><p>(1:45) The Chinese AI Ecosystem: Pre and Post ChatGPT</p><p>(3:49) Government Influence and Private Sector Dynamics</p><p>(6:39) Venture Funding and Major Players</p><p>(8:40) Talent and International Collaboration</p><p>(11:25) Open Source Models and Market Dynamics</p><p>(31:17) US-China AI Policy and Strategic Competition</p><p>(36:18) The Argument for Selling AI Accelerators</p><p>(37:02) Risks of Not Selling to China</p><p>(39:22) The Complexity of Export Controls</p><p>(40:40) The Status Quo of the Chip Ban</p><p>(43:34) Technological Constraints and Huawei's Challenges</p><p>(51:18) US-China Relations and Taiwan</p><p>(1:02:46) Quickfire</p><p> </p><p>With your co-hosts: </p><p>@jacobeffron </p><p>- Partner at Redpoint, Former PM Flatiron Health </p><p>@patrickachase </p><p>- Partner at Redpoint, Former ML Engineer LinkedIn </p><p>@ericabrescia </p><p>- Former COO Github, Founder Bitnami (acq’d by VMWare) </p><p>@jordan_segall </p><p>- Partner at Redpoint</p>\n",

Sarah gives a “tour of the arguments” on what ultimately led to the Soviet Union’s collapse, diving into the role of the US, the Sino-Soviet border conflict, the oil bust, ethnic rebellions and even the Roman Catholic Church. As she points out, this is all particularly interesting as we find ourselves potentially at the beginning of another Cold War.</p><p>As we wrap up this lecture series, I want to take a moment to thank Sarah for doing this with me. It has been such a pleasure.</p><p>If you want more of her scholarship, I highly recommend checking out the books she’s written.

Here are the show notes from that episode:</p>\n<p>My guest today is entrepreneur and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman. He’s now facing something most tech business people never imagine: being personally targeted by a sitting president’s Department of Justice. Reid and I talk through the rise of politically motivated prosecutions, the erosion of trust in institutions, and how social media and AI have accelerated our collective slide into suspicion. We get into deepfakes, vaccine skepticism, the inequality debate, and whether billionaires should exist at all. Reid also walks me through what it’s like to wait for an indictment he believes is purely retaliatory. This is a conversation about democratic guardrails, not partisan talking points—and about what happens when political power becomes personal.</p>\n<p>A big thanks to The Free Press and Conversations with Coleman podcast, available at theFP.com. </p>",

It's a puzzling question: episodes are four hours long, they come out infrequently, and they usually don’t have guests or video. Hardly the standard-issue playbook for podcasting success! And yet well over a million smart, curious and exceedingly busy humans share their (your!) valuable time with us every month. Why? This is the exact paradox that has been rolling around in the head of Michael Lewis (yes, <em>that</em> Michael Lewis) since he found the show earlier this year.</p><p>So we asked Michael to be our guest \"interlocutor\" and share what <em>he</em> thinks is going on here, while we share ten lessons we've stolen (graciously) from companies we've studied and brought into Acquired itself. He takes us through the entire Acquired journey: how we started, why we've never hired anyone or raised money, how we pick episodes, what our business model actually is, why we focus on quality and enjoyment over maximizing enterprise value, and ultimately why we’re all — you, him, us — kindred spirits together. Oh, and just for fun, we recorded this episode where another special journey began — the garage where Google was founded.</p><p>Thank you for an incredible decade together… here's to the next one!</p><p><br><em>Thank-yous:</em></p><ul><li><em>First, to Google for loaning us the garage. The sawhorse table desk, PC and CRT monitor on display in the background were all Google originals courtesy of the Google Founders Collection at the Computer History Museum.

Drawing on his journey from early software entrepreneur to leading a16z’s apps fund, Alex shared how high agency, deep historical understanding, and the ability to attract talent, capital, and customers separate great founders from the rest. He reflected on motivation beyond money, explaining why “revenge or redemption” often fuels the resilience required to push through the hardest moments of company building.</p><p> </p><p>Resources:</p><p>Follow Alex Rampell on X: <a href=\"https://x.com/arampell?lang=en\">https://twitter.com/arampell</a> <br />Follow John Coogan on X: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johncoogan\">https://twitter.com/johncoogan</a> <br />Follow Jordi Hays on X: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jordihays\">https://twitter.com/jordihays</a></p><p>Listen to more from TBPN: <a href=\"https://www.tbpn.com/\">https://www.tbpn.com/</a></p><p> </p><p>Stay Updated: </p><p>If you enjoyed this episode, be sure to like, subscribe, and share with your friends!</p><p>Find a16z on X: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/a16z\">https://twitter.com/a16z</a></p><p>Find a16z on LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z</a></p><p>Listen to the a16z Podcast on Spotify: <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/5bC65RDvs3oxnLyqqvkUYX\">https://open.spotify.com/show/5bC65RDvs3oxnLyqqvkUYX</a></p><p>Listen to the a16z Podcast on Apple Podcasts: <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a16z-podcast/id842818711\">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a16z-podcast/id842818711</a></p><p>Please note that the content here is for informational purposes only; should NOT be taken as legal, business, tax, or investment advice or be used to evaluate any investment or security; and is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any a16z fund. a16z and its affiliates may maintain investments in the companies discussed.

The company operates on four continents, serves <strong>5,000+ hospitals and health facilities</strong>, and delivers food, retail, and healthcare products directly to customers’ homes in minutes. Zipline’s zero-emission aircraft have delivered <strong>more than 20 million items</strong> with no serious injuries and are saving <strong>10,000+ lives per year</strong> in the process.</p><p>In the U.S., Zipline is scaling at exceptional speed. U.S. deliveries have grown by approximately <strong>15% week over week for the last seven months</strong>, and Keller shares that Zipline now does <strong>more deliveries in the United States than the rest of the world combined</strong>. In Dallas, Zipline’s first site took <strong>10 weeks</strong> to reach 100 deliveries per day, while newer sites reached that same volume in just <strong>2 days</strong>—a clear signal the system is moving from early adoption to everyday infrastructure.</p><p>We also cover Zipline’s upcoming launches in <strong>Houston and Phoenix</strong>, where customers will soon be able to order tens of thousands of items with deliveries arriving in as little as <strong>10 minutes</strong>, Zipline’s vertically integrated manufacturing strategy, and why Keller believes autonomous, on-demand logistics will soon be the norm across multiple U.S. states.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Keller R.

If not, then it's just lack of imagination.”</li><li>“I have no doubts that AI capabilities are just going to increase more and more over the next few years.

The first is finding a simple idea and taking it extraordinarily seriously. Reed talks about how even the DVD business was nothing more than a stepping stone toward streaming, which they envisioned from the company’s inception in 1997. The second is talent density, and what it actually takes to set and sustain an exceptionally high bar over decades as a company grows. </p>\n<p>We talk about how those ideas shaped Netflix’s culture and strategy, what Reed learned from mistakes like Qwikster, and why Netflix treated content like a venture portfolio.</p>\n<p>We also discuss Reed’s work today. He shares how he’s thinking about AI, what he’s learned from serving on the boards of Microsoft, Meta, Anthropic, and Bloomberg, and what excites him about Powder Mountain, the ski resort he acquired after Netflix.</p>\n<p>Please enjoy my conversation with Reed Hastings.</p>\n<p>For the full show notes, transcript, and links to mentioned content, check out the episode page <a href=\"https://joincolossus.com/episode/building-netflix/\"><u>⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠here⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠</u></a><u>.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠</u></p>\n<p><strong>-----</strong></p>\n<p><strong>This episode is brought to you by</strong>⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠<a href=\"http://ramp.com/invest\"><strong> </strong><u>⁠</u><strong>Ramp</strong><u>⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠</u></a><strong>.

He outlines Anduril’s growth to roughly <strong>7,000 employees</strong>, <strong>$1B+ in revenue with continued YoY doubling</strong>, and a reported <strong>$30.5B valuation (too low?)</strong>, while addressing <strong>IPO speculation &amp; these wild “fake SPVs</strong>.”</p><p>The conversation covers geopolitical instability, production constraints in the U.S. defense industrial base, and how the nearly <strong>$1 trillion defense budget</strong> is actually allocated to personnel, infrastructure, and sustainment, rather than new procurement. Schimpf draws on leadership lessons from <strong>Palantir</strong>, highlighting creativity, high agency (“Artisty &amp; Meritocracy’), and long-term alignment with military needs.</p><p>Schimpf also explains Anduril’s expansion from early autonomous systems into a portfolio spanning <strong>autonomous aircraft, cruise missiles, electronic warfare, and networked sensing and command platforms</strong>, enabled by a shared software and hardware foundation built around <strong>Lattice</strong>. Emphasizing the company’s focus on a <strong>distributed, autonomous battlefield</strong> and the ability to rapidly field new capabilities.</p><p><strong>FWIW:</strong> Spending time on Anduril’s campus ahead of the final interview of the day offered such a strong view into the scale and complexity of the organization Brian is leading. Walking through the facility and meeting with the founding team made the scope of Anduril’s operations very real, but also highlighted just how complementary their skill sets are and how that translates into execution at scale. And with that, I have concluded that given the company’s growth, momentum, &amp; market position.. Anduril may still be undervalued.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Brian Schimpf: </strong><a href=\"https://x.com/SchimpfBrian\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://x.com/SchimpfBrian</a> </p><p><strong>Molly O’Shea:</strong> ⁠<a href=\"https://x.com/MollySOShea%E2%81%A0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://x.com/MollySOShea⁠</a></p><p><strong>Sourcery:</strong> ⁠<a href=\"https://x.com/sourceryvc%E2%81%A0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://x.com/sourceryvc</a></p><p><br></p><p>𝐄𝐏𝐈𝐒𝐎𝐃𝐄 𝐋𝐈𝐍𝐊𝐒</p><p>YouTube : <a href=\"https://youtu.be/P5dsb28UVec\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferer\">https://youtu.be/P5dsb28UVec</a><br></p><p><strong>𝐒𝐏𝐎𝐍𝐒𝐎𝐑𝐒</strong></p><p>• <a href=\"https://brex.com/sourcery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Brex</strong></a>—The modern finance platform, combining the world’s smartest corporate card with integrated expense management, banking, bill pay, &amp; travel. <a href=\"https://brex.com/sourcery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://brex.com/sourcery</a></p><p>• <a href=\"https://turing.com/sourcery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Turing</strong></a>—Turing delivers top-tier talent, data, and tools to help AI labs improve model performance—and enables enterprises to turn those models into powerful, production-ready systems. <a href=\"https://turing.com/sourcery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://turing.com/sourcery</a></p><p>• <a href=\"https://carta.com/sourcery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Carta</strong></a>—Carta connects founders, investors, and limited partners through software purpose-built for private capital.

                    "description": "<p>My guest this week is <a href=\"https://x.com/GavinSBaker\">Gavin Bake</a>r. Gavin is the managing partner and CIO of Atreides Management, and he has been on the show many times before. </p>\n<p>I will never forget when I first met Gavin in 2017. I find his interest in markets, his curiosity about the world to be as infectious as any investor that I've ever come across. He's encyclopedic on what is going on in the world of technology today, and I've had the good fortune to host him every year or two on this podcast.</p>\n<p>Gavin began covering Nvidia as an investor more than two decades ago, giving him a rare perspective on how the company – and the entire semiconductor ecosystem – has evolved. A lot has changed since our <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/05Fx7yNSEA148kHr1znbrb\"><u>last conversation</u></a> a year ago, making this the perfect time to revisit the topic.</p>\n<p>In this conversation, we talk about everything that interests Gavin – Nvidia’s GPUs, Google’s TPUs, the changing AI landscape, the math and business models around AI companies and everything in between. We also discussed the idea of data centers in space, which he communicates with his usual passion and logic.</p>\n<p>In closing, at the end of this conversation, because I've asked him my traditional closing question before, I asked him a different question, which led to a discussion of his entire investing origin story that I had never heard before.</p>\n<p>Because Gavin is one of the most passionate thinkers and investors that I know, these conversations are always amongst my most favorite. I hope you enjoy this latest in the series of discussions with Gavin Baker.</p>\n<p>For the full show notes, transcript, and links to mentioned content, check out the episode page <a href=\"https://joincolossus.com/episode/nvidia-v-google-%E2%80%A6-economics-of-ai/\"><u>⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠here⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠</u></a><u>.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠</u></p>\n<p><strong>-----</strong></p>\n<p><strong>This episode is brought to you by</strong>⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠<strong> </strong><a href=\"http://ramp.com/invest\"><strong>Ramp</strong><u>⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠</u></a><strong>.

On this episode of the Tech Disruptors podcast, Max Levchin, CEO and founder of Affirm and co-founder of PayPal, joins Bloomberg Intelligence global fintech and payments analyst Diksha Gera to discuss how machine learning is replacing static underwriting with real-time, transaction-level intelligence. They also explore why this shift could fundamentally reshape the economics of consumer lending over the next decade.\n\n\n</p>",

He outlines Anduril’s growth to roughly <strong>7,000 employees</strong>, <strong>$1B+ in revenue with continued YoY doubling</strong>, and a reported <strong>$30.5B valuation (too low?)</strong>, while addressing <strong>IPO speculation &amp; these wild “fake SPVs</strong>.”</p><p>The conversation covers geopolitical instability, production constraints in the U.S. defense industrial base, and how the nearly <strong>$1 trillion defense budget</strong> is actually allocated to personnel, infrastructure, and sustainment, rather than new procurement. Schimpf draws on leadership lessons from <strong>Palantir</strong>, highlighting creativity, high agency (“Artisty &amp; Meritocracy’), and long-term alignment with military needs.</p><p>Schimpf also explains Anduril’s expansion from early autonomous systems into a portfolio spanning <strong>autonomous aircraft, cruise missiles, electronic warfare, and networked sensing and command platforms</strong>, enabled by a shared software and hardware foundation built around <strong>Lattice</strong>. Emphasizing the company’s focus on a <strong>distributed, autonomous battlefield</strong> and the ability to rapidly field new capabilities.</p><p><strong>FWIW:</strong> Spending time on Anduril’s campus ahead of the final interview of the day offered such a strong view into the scale and complexity of the organization Brian is leading. Walking through the facility and meeting with the founding team made the scope of Anduril’s operations very real, but also highlighted just how complementary their skill sets are and how that translates into execution at scale. And with that, I have concluded that given the company’s growth, momentum, &amp; market position.. Anduril may still be undervalued.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Brian Schimpf: </strong><a href=\"https://x.com/SchimpfBrian\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://x.com/SchimpfBrian</a> </p><p><strong>Molly O’Shea:</strong> ⁠<a href=\"https://x.com/MollySOShea%E2%81%A0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://x.com/MollySOShea⁠</a></p><p><strong>Sourcery:</strong> ⁠<a href=\"https://x.com/sourceryvc%E2%81%A0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://x.com/sourceryvc</a></p><p><br></p><p>𝐄𝐏𝐈𝐒𝐎𝐃𝐄 𝐋𝐈𝐍𝐊𝐒</p><p>YouTube : <a href=\"https://youtu.be/P5dsb28UVec\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferer\">https://youtu.be/P5dsb28UVec</a><br></p><p><strong>𝐒𝐏𝐎𝐍𝐒𝐎𝐑𝐒</strong></p><p>• <a href=\"https://brex.com/sourcery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Brex</strong></a>—The modern finance platform, combining the world’s smartest corporate card with integrated expense management, banking, bill pay, &amp; travel. <a href=\"https://brex.com/sourcery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://brex.com/sourcery</a></p><p>• <a href=\"https://turing.com/sourcery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Turing</strong></a>—Turing delivers top-tier talent, data, and tools to help AI labs improve model performance—and enables enterprises to turn those models into powerful, production-ready systems. <a href=\"https://turing.com/sourcery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://turing.com/sourcery</a></p><p>• <a href=\"https://carta.com/sourcery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Carta</strong></a>—Carta connects founders, investors, and limited partners through software purpose-built for private capital.

He has built the core ad and product businesses at Google, Facebook, Square, and DoorDash, working at each company during its most formative scaling periods.</p>\n<p>Alongside his operating career, Gokul has invested in more than 700 companies, giving him an unusually broad view into how products are built and scaled.</p>\n<p>This conversation is about how product building is changing with AI. We discuss the one thing Gokul believes is truly future-proof in AI, why companies like Zendesk and Slack are more exposed than Salesforce or NetSuite, and the only sources of defensibility. </p>\n<p>We also talk about everything Gokul has learned from helping build the most important ads businesses, including the only three ways an ad business can make money, how those constraints shape product decisions, and what consumer behavior change threatens every major platform.</p>\n<p>Gokul shares lessons from working closely with Larry and Sergey, Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey, and Tony Xu.</p>\n<p>Please enjoy my conversation with Gokul Rajaram.</p>\n<p>For the full show notes, transcript, and links to mentioned content, check out the episode page <a href=\"https://colossus.com/episode/lessons-from-investing-in-700-companies\">⁠<u>⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠here⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠</u>⁠</a>. </p>\n<p><strong>-----</strong></p>\n<p><strong>This episode is brought to you by</strong>⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠<a href=\"http://ramp.com/invest\">⁠<strong> </strong><u>⁠</u><strong>Ramp</strong><u>⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠</u>⁠</a><strong>.

The end of Moore’s Law—says NVIDIA President, Founder, and CEO Jensen Huang—makes the shift to accelerated computing inevitable, regardless of any talk of an AI “bubble.” Sarah Guo and Elad Gil are joined by Jensen Huang for a wide-ranging discussion on the state of artificial intelligence as we begin 2026. Jensen reflects on the biggest surprises of 2025, including the rapid improvements in reasoning, as well as the profitability of inference tokens. He also talks about why AI will increase productivity without necessarily taking away jobs, and how physical AI and robotics can help to solve labor shortages. Finally, Jensen shares his 2026 outlook, including why he’s optimistic about US-China relations, why open source remains essential for keeping the US competitive, and which sectors are due for their “ChatGPT moment.” </p>\n<p>Sign up for new podcasts every week.

Under the Trump administration, the US Department of War (DoW) is deploying generative AI to millions of employees in order to maintain a strategic edge over our global adversaries. Sarah Guo and Elad Gil sit down with Emil Michael, the Under Secretary of War for Research and Engineering of the United States, to discuss the radical technological transformation of the US military. Emil outlines the architecture and launch of GenAI.mil, a DoW internal AI platform powered by Gemini and Grok that reached over one million unique users in its first 30 days. He also highlights critical technology priorities for national security, including hypersonics, direct energy, and autonomous drone swarms. Together, they also explore the urgent need to rebuild the American defense industrial base and end dependency on foreign supply chains for critical materials, as well as how Emil is recruiting the next generation of “fixer-builder” workers to serve their country in government. </p>\n<p>Sign up for new podcasts every week.

Martin has lived through multiple tech waves as a founder, researcher, and investor, and in this discussion he shares how he thinks about the AI boom, why he believes we’re still early in the cycle, and how a market-first lens shapes his approach to investing.</p><p>They also dig into the mechanics behind the scenes: why AI coding could become a multi-trillion-dollar market, how a16z evolved from a small generalist firm into a specialized organization, the growing role of open-source models, and why Martin believes AGI debates often obscure more meaningful questions about how technology actually creates value.</p><p> </p><p>Follow Mario Gabriele</p><p>X: https://x.com/mariogabriele</p><p>https://www.generalist.com/</p><p> </p><p>Follow Martin Casado:</p><p>LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/martincasado/</p><p>X: <a href=\"https://x.com/martin_casado\">https://x.com/martin_casado</a></p><p> </p><p>The Generalist Substack: <a href=\"https://www.generalist.com/\">https://www.generalist.com/</a></p><p>The Generalist on YouTube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@TheGeneralistPodcast\">https://www.youtube.com/@TheGeneralistPodcast</a></p><p>Spotify: <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/6mHuHe0Tj6XVxpgaw4WsJV\">https://open.spotify.com/show/6mHuHe0Tj6XVxpgaw4WsJV</a></p><p>Apple: <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-generalist/id1805868710\">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-generalist/id1805868710</a></p>\n<p><p>Check out everything a16z is doing with artificial intelligence <a href=\"https://a16z.com/ai/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, including articles, projects, and more podcasts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Please note that the content here is for informational purposes only; should NOT be taken as legal, business, tax, or investment advice or be used to evaluate any investment or security; and is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any a16z fund. a16z and its affiliates may maintain investments in the companies discussed.

The conversation places AI in the context of prior platform waves, from PCs to cloud to mobile, and examines where adoption is already translating into real enterprise usage and revenue. They walk through three core investment themes: existing software categories becoming AI-native, new categories where software directly replaces labor, and applications built around proprietary data and closed-loop workflows. Using portfolio examples, the discussion shows how these models play out in practice and why defensibility, workflow ownership, and data moats matter more than novelty as AI applications scale.</p><p> </p><p>Resources:</p><p>Follow  Alex Rampell on X: <a href=\"https://x.com/arampell\">https://twitter.com/arampell</a></p><p>Follow Jen Kha on X:<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jkhamehl\"> https://twitter.com/jkhamehl</a></p><p>Follow David Haber on X: <a href=\"https://x.com/dhaber\">https://twitter.com/dhaber</a></p><p>Follow Anish Acharya on X: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/illscience\">https://twitter.com/illscience</a></p><p> </p><p>Stay Updated:</p><p>If you enjoyed this episode, be sure to like, subscribe, and share with your friends!</p><p>Find a16z on X: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/a16z\">https://twitter.com/a16z</a></p><p>Find a16z on LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z</a></p><p>Listen to the a16z Podcast on Spotify: <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/5bC65RDvs3oxnLyqqvkUYX\">https://open.spotify.com/show/5bC65RDvs3oxnLyqqvkUYX</a></p><p>Listen to the a16z Podcast on Apple Podcasts: <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a16z-podcast/id842818711\">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a16z-podcast/id842818711</a></p><p>Not an offer or solicitation.

David has been involved in backing many of the defining companies of this era and is now investing behind a new wave of AI startups.</p><p>This discussion goes deep into how the a16z growth practice operates: how the team hires and develops a “Yankees-level” culture, how investment decisions get made without traditional committees, and how they build long-term relationships with founders years before investing.</p><p>A major focus is AI. David talks through how the team is investing across the stack and why he believes this period could create some of the largest companies ever built.</p><p>He also walks through the models that guide his thinking: why markets often misprice consistent growth, what makes “pull” businesses so durable, why many important markets become winner-take-all, and what he’s learned from studying exceptional founders — especially the “technical terminators” he’s drawn to.</p><p> </p><p>Resources:</p><p>Follow Harry Stebbings on X: https://twitter.com/HarryStebbings</p><p>Follow David George on X: https://twitter.com/DavidGeorge83</p><p> </p><p>Stay Updated:</p><p>If you enjoyed this episode, be sure to like, subscribe, and share with your friends!</p><p>Find a16z on X: https://twitter.com/a16z</p><p>Find a16z on LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z</a></p><p>Listen to the a16z Podcast on Spotify: <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/5bC65RDvs3oxnLyqqvkUYX\">https://open.spotify.com/show/5bC65RDvs3oxnLyqqvkUYX</a></p><p>Listen to the a16z Podcast on Apple Podcasts: <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a16z-podcast/id842818711\">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a16z-podcast/id842818711</a></p><p>Please note that the content here is for informational purposes only; should NOT be taken as legal, business, tax, or investment advice or be used to evaluate any investment or security; and is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any a16z fund. a16z and its affiliates may maintain investments in the companies discussed.

Martin has lived through multiple tech waves as a founder, researcher, and investor, and in this discussion he shares how he thinks about the AI boom, why he believes we’re still early in the cycle, and how a market-first lens shapes his approach to investing.</p><p>They also dig into the mechanics behind the scenes: why AI coding could become a multi-trillion-dollar market, how a16z evolved from a small generalist firm into a specialized organization, the growing role of open-source models, and why Martin believes AGI debates often obscure more meaningful questions about how technology actually creates value.</p><p> </p><p>Resources:</p><p>Follow Mario Gabriele</p><p>X: https://x.com/mariogabriele</p><p>https://www.generalist.com/</p><p>Follow Martin Casado:</p><p>LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/martincasado/</p><p>X: <a href=\"https://x.com/martin_casado\">https://x.com/martin_casado</a></p><p>The Generalist Substack: <a href=\"https://www.generalist.com/\">https://www.generalist.com/</a></p><p>The Generalist on YouTube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@TheGeneralistPodcast\">https://www.youtube.com/@TheGeneralistPodcast</a></p><p>Spotify: <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/6mHuHe0Tj6XVxpgaw4WsJV\">https://open.spotify.com/show/6mHuHe0Tj6XVxpgaw4WsJV</a></p><p>Apple: <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-generalist/id1805868710\">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-generalist/id1805868710</a></p><p> </p><p>Stay Updated:</p><p>If you enjoyed this episode, be sure to like, subscribe, and share with your friends!</p><p>Find a16z on X: https://x.com/a16z</p><p>Find a16z on LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z</a></p><p>Listen to the a16z Podcast on Spotify: <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/5bC65RDvs3oxnLyqqvkUYX\">https://open.spotify.com/show/5bC65RDvs3oxnLyqqvkUYX</a></p><p>Listen to the a16z Podcast on Apple Podcasts: <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a16z-podcast/id842818711\">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a16z-podcast/id842818711</a></p><p>Please note that the content here is for informational purposes only; should NOT be taken as legal, business, tax, or investment advice or be used to evaluate any investment or security; and is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any a16z fund. a16z and its affiliates may maintain investments in the companies discussed.

In 2019 at just 26 years old, Saam became the Greylock’s youngest General Partner in its 54-year history – a remarkable achievement at an institution that had backed Airbnb, AppDynamics, Coinbase, Discord, Figma, Instagram, LinkedIn, among others.</p>\n<p>Saam’s portfolio spans 14+ companies with collective valuations exceeding $10 billion. Abnormal Security, which Greylock incubated in its offices in 2018 with Saam as founding investor, grew into a multi-billion-dollar email security powerhouse. Cresta, where he led the Series A in 2019, became the leading generative AI platform for contact centers. Snorkel AI, Braintrust, Orb, and a portfolio of other infrastructure companies position Saam at the center of AI's business model transformation.</p>\n<p>We covered:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Durable components to great firms</li>\n  <li>Inside look at how Greylock operates</li>\n  <li>Cracking the code on incubations</li>\n  <li>Alpha in today’s venture strategies</li>\n</ul>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Timestamps:</p>\n<p>(0:00) Intro</p>\n<p>(1:32) Greylock turning 60 this year</p>\n<p>(4:11) What’s persisted since 1965</p>\n<p>(8:59) An apprenticeship model</p>\n<p>(11:34) Durable components to firms</p>\n<p>(16:29) Greylock’s brand and ethos</p>\n<p>(19:33) Incentive misalignments</p>\n<p>(24:44) Breadth vs depth in venture</p>\n<p>(29:28) Inputs based management</p>\n<p>(34:00) Why incubations are so hard</p>\n<p>(43:22) Where there’s alpha in venture</p>\n<p>(52:38) Greylock’s approach to portfolio services</p>\n<p>(59:18) Assessing wild revenue ramps</p>\n<p>(1:08:10) Horizontal vs vertical SaaS</p>\n<p>(1:11:34) Great friends in venture</p>\n<p>(1:16:26) Health and sustainable routines</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>More on Saam:</p>\n<p>https://greylock.com/</p>\n<p>https://x.com/saammotamedi</p>\n<p>More on Jack:</p>\n<p>https://www.altcap.com/</p>\n<p>https://x.com/jaltma</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>https://linktr.ee/uncappedpod</p>\n<p>Email: friends@uncappedpod.com</p>",
